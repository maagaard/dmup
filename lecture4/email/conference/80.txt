Analysis of Neural Data 
_______________________

Modern methods and open issues in the analysis
and interpretation of multi-variate time-series
and imaging data in the neurosciences

A working group of scientists committed to 
quantitative approaches to problems in neuroscience
will focus their efforts on experimental and 
theoretical issues related to the analysis of large,
single- and multi-channel data sets. 

The motivation for the work group is based on issues
that arise in two complimentary areas critical to an
understanding of brain function. The first involves 
advanced signal processing methods, particularly 
those appropriate for emerging multi-site recording 
techniques and noninvasive imaging techniques. The 
second involves the development of a calculus to 
study the dynamical behavior of nervous systems and 
the computations they perform. 

A distinguishing feature of the work group will be 
the close collaboration between experimentalists and 
theorists, particularly with regard to the analysis 
of data and the planning of experiments. The work 
group will have a limited number of research 
lectures, supplemented by tutorials on relevant 
computational, experimental, and mathematical
techniques. 

This work group is a means to critically evaluate 
techniques for the processing of multi-channel data, 
of which imaging forms an important category. Such 
techniques are of fundamental importance for basic 
research and medical diagnostics. We will establish a
repository of these techniques, along with benchmarks, 
to insure the rapidly dissemination of modern 
analytical techniques throughout the neuroscience 
community. 

The work group will convene on a yearly basis. 
For 1997, we propose to focus on topics that
fall under the rubric of multivariate time-series. 

* Analysis of point processes, e.g., spike trains. 
Measures of correlation and variability, and their 
interpretation. 
* Analysis of continuous processes, e.g., field 
potential, optical imaging, fMRI, and MEG, and
the recording of behavioral output, e.g., 
vocalizations. 
* Problems that involve both point and continuous 
processes, e.g., the linear and nonlinear functional 
relations between spike trains and sensory input 
and motor output. 

Participants: Twenty five participants, both 
experimentalists and theorists. Experimentalists are 
specifically encouraged to bring data records to the 
work group; appropriate computational facilities will 
be provided. The work group will further take 
advantage of interested investigators and course 
faculty concurrently present at the MBL. We encourage 
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as well 
as senior researchers to apply. 

Participant Fee: $200. 

Support: National Institutes of Health -
NIMH, NIA, NIAAA, NICHD/NCRR, NIDCD, NIDA, and NINDS. 

Organizers: David Kleinfeld (UCSD) and 
	Partha P. Mitra (Caltech and Bell Laboratories).
