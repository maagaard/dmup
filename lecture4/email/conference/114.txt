SCOPE:
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

ICANN 98 covers all aspects of ANN research, broadly divided into six
areas, corresponding to separate organizational modules.

-       THEORY
-       APPLICATIONS
-       COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE AND BRAIN THEORY
-       CONNECTIONIST COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND AI
-       AUTONOMOUS ROBOTICS AND ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR
-       HARDWARE/IMPLEMENTATION

Out of 340 submissions, 180 papers have been accepted for presentation.
65 of these will be presented orally in 3 parallel tracks, and 115 will
be
presented in two separate poster sessions.


In addition to the modules mentioned above we aim to further promote
contacts between researchers and industry. To achieve this, a special
session on INDUSTRY AND RESEARCH is organized, featuring the following
talks: 

Neural Computation at Siemens: Challenges in Applications and
Research, Bernd Schuermann, Siemens, Germany

Toward Real World Intelligence: R&D in the Real World Computing
Program, Nobuyuki Otsu, ETL, Japan

Industry - researchers interface: What is important for effective
co-operation?, Timo Salo, Helsinki University, Finland

Industrial perspective on ANN-research, Tony Larsson, Ericsson, Sweden

Funding programs in Europe, Karl-Einar Sjödin, NUTEK, Sweden

Technology transfer from European academia to industry
Trevor Clarkson, King's College London, NEuroNet, Great Britain
