Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference 1999
8th - 9th September 1999
Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland

Scope

The 1999 Irish Machine Vision & Image Processing (IMVIP) Conference will
be
hosted by the School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University,
bringing together theoreticians and practitioners, industrialists
and academics, from the numerous related disciplines involved in the
processing and analysis of image-based information.

IMVIP '99 is a single-track conference consisting of high quality
previously
unpublished contributed papers, presented orally. The conference
emphasises both theoretical research results and practical engineering
experience in all areas. Full papers will be subject to a double-blind
review process by the programme committee. In addition to the
contributed programme, there will also be talks by invited speakers.

Topics

Contributions are sought in all aspects of image processing, pattern
analysis and machine vision, including but not restricted to
the following topics:

Visually Guided Robot Manipulation and Navigation
Texture, Colour, Stereo and Motion Analysis
Image & Video Representation, Compression and Coding
Bio- and Medical Imaging
Active Vision and Tracking
Object and Event Recognition
2D and 3D Scene Analysis
Remote Sensing
Image/Shape Representation and Recovery
Mathematical Morphology
Applications, Architectures and Systems Integration

Instructions For Submission

Authors who wish to present a paper at the conference should send four
copies of their paper to the address given below by April 30th 1999.

IMVIP '99 Secretariat
Vision Systems Laboratory,
School of Electronic Engineering
Dublin City University,
Dublin 9, Ireland.

Full papers, not exceeding 15 printed pages (12 pt font, single-spacing)
should be submitted for anonymous review. To enable the double-blind
review process there should be two title pages. The first should contain
the
paper title, author's name, affiliation and address, telephone, fax and
e-mail, an abstract of 300 words clearly stating the impact of the
contribution and up to five keywords. The second title page should
consist only of the title, abstract and keywords.
