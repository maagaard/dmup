four double-column, single-spaced pages) papers.  Both formats will be
peer-reviewed.  The length of the paper should be appropriate to the
results presented.  Papers are solicited, and will be reviewed, as either
research or applied:

RESEARCH PAPERS should describe results that contribute to the
advancement the state of the art in virtual reality software, hardware, 
3-D
CHI,
or systems development.

APPLIED PAPERS should present prototype or fielded virtual reality
systems.  Applied papers should include a concise description of the
application area, provide insight into the relevant VR system 
implementation
issues, and discuss the effectiveness of the VR system with respect to the
application area.

Papers must include a COVER PAGE that lists:
1.      Complete title of the paper.
2.      Names and affiliations of all authors.
3.      Type of paper (research or applied).
4.      Paper format (long or short).
5.      The name, postal address, phone, fax, and email address of the 
author
designated as the point-of-contact for the paper.
6.      Whether an associated video tape has been submitted with the paper
for the
reviewers.

Send SIX COPIES of the full paper and associated videotapes to:

POSTER PRESENTATIONS
Posters should present preliminary results of new or on- going work in
virtual reality.  A poster proposal of not more than two pages  should be
submitted for review by the program co-chairs.  Posters that are accepted
for presentation at VRAIS '97 will also be invited to submit a one-page
abstract that will be published in the Proceedings.  Each poster
presentation proposal submitted should include the complete title of the
poster, names and affiliations of all authors, and the name, postal
address, phone, fax, and e-mail address of the author designated as the
point-of-contact for the poster.
Poster presentation proposals should be submitted via e-mail to Larry F.
Hodges at hodges@cc.gatech.edu.

PANELS
Panels are presentations that cover a specific area from several
perspectives including lively discussion of controversial issues. Panel
proposals should include: a title for the panel session; a brief
description of the overall issues to be discussed; an abstract of each
panelist's presentation; and the names and contact information of the
organizer and panelists. Panel proposals should be submitted via e-mail to
Larry F.  Hodges at hodges@cc.gatech.edu.

VIDEOS
Video submissions demonstrate hardware and software systems and
applications. Each video should stand on its own. A submission consists 
of:
3 copies of a video segment not to exceed 5 minutes in length in 1/2 inch
NTSC VHS format; a one-page information sheet containing a 200 word
abstract plus references and acknowledgments; title, authors, 
affiliations,
and contact information including email address for the lead author. Label
tapes with title and authors. Videos should be submitted to Norman Badler,
University of Pennsylvania, badler@cis.upenn.edu

TUTORIALS AND WORKSHOPS
Tutorials are half-day or full-day in length covering topics of interest 
to
the virtual reality community. They may be introductory or advanced and
address general or specialized topics. Workshops are full-day in length 
and
should bring together researchers and developers interested in a targeted
application or topic for lively discussion of issues and informal exchange
of ideas and information.  Tutorial and Workshop proposals should be
submitted to Tom Caudell, University of New Mexico, tpc@eece.unm.edu

EXHIBITS
Vendors, manufacturers, and publishers are invited to display and
demonstrate their latest innovations to  a highly targeted group of
researchers and developers in VR.  For information on exhibiting at VRAIS
'97 contact Henry Sowizral, Sun Microsystems Computer Corp,
sowizral@hsmpk14a-103.Eng.Sun.COM

Aims and Scope
--------------

With the continuing advances being made in interactive simulation 
environments,
the appeal of low-cost, low-risk training systems is especially important 
to
domains where mistakes during real-world training can be extremely 
expensive as
well as dangerous. For example, such domains include medicine, military
training, air traffic control, and nuclear waste disposal. Training in
distributed virtual environments provides great potential for providing 
the
level of realism required to adequately train individuals for these tasks 
while
increasing safety as well as minimizing costs.

Common among the above domains is the need for intelligent autonomous 
agents to
populate the virtual environment. This is especially important in large 
scale
simulations where the number of entities/actors required can far exceed 
the
number of people available to participate. Such agents may also include 
monitors
or sentinels whose job is to watch the simulation and provide advice or 
alerts
as well as present the information in a way most accessible for potential 
human
users.

This special issue focuses on the use of artificial intelligence within 
virtual
environments. For example, state-of-the-art research on the design, 
development
and/or architecture of intelligent autonomous agents for virtual 
environments as
well as intelligent user interfaces are of interest. In addition, we also
welcome survey papers and reviews on progress made in the past few years 
and
descriptions of the significant problems that remain to be addressed.

This special issue is being published on an accelerated schedule, with 
acceptance notification to be made five months after receipt of 
manuscript.

    --  User Intent

For papers focused on applications in specific domains, they should 
address
issues such as:

    -- Why was AI necessary for your domain?
    -- What practical problems did you encounter?
    -- What distinguishing properties of your domain dictated your AI 
approach?
    -- What methods were used to measure the effectiveness of the system?
    -- What AI approaches were effective (ineffective)?
