The Second Asia-Pacific Conference on Simulated Evolution And Learning
(SEAL'98)

		            Canberra, Australia

			    24-27 November 1998

				Hosted by 
			School of Computer Science
	     University College, the University of New South Wales
	Australian Defence Force Academy, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia

			    in cooperation with
	COMPLEX SYSTEMS '98, Sydney, Australia, Nov 30 - Dec 4, 1998

Aims and Scopes
---------------

Evolution and learning are two fundamental forms of adaptation. This
conference follows the successful SEAL'96 (The First Asia-Pacific
Conference on Simulated Evolution And Learning) in Taejon, Korea, 9-12
November 1996, and aims at exploring these two forms of adaptation and
their roles and interactions in adaptive systems. Cross-fertilisation between
evolutionary learning and other machine learning approaches, such as
neural network learning, reinforcement learning, decision tree learning,
fuzzy system learning, etc., will be strongly encouraged by the conference.
The other major theme of the conference is optimisation by evolutionary
approaches or hybrid evolutionary approaches. 

The conference will feature both academic and application streams
in order to encourage more interactions between researchers and
practitioners in the field of simulated evolution and learning. To provide
timely feedback, the applications stream will use a two-stage reviewing
process featuring preliminary acceptance by abstract and final acceptance
by complete paper. The refereeing panel for the applications stream will
consist of eminent practitioners in the field.

The topics of interest to this conference include but are not limited to
the following:

1. Evolutionary Learning

+ Fundamental Issues in Evolutionary Learning 
  (e.g., Generalisation, Scalability, and Computational Complexity)
+ Co-Evolutionary Learning
+ Modular Evolutionary Learning Systems
+ Classifier Systems
+ Artificial Immune Systems
+ Representation Issue in Evolutionary Learning 
  (e.g., rules, trees, graphs, etc.)
+ Interactions Between Learning and Evolution
+ Comparison between Evolutionary Learning and Other Learning Approaches
  (Neural Network, Decision Tree, Reinforcement Learning, etc.)

2. Evolutionary Optimisation

+ Global (Numerical/Function) Optimisation
+ Combinatorial Optimisation (e.g., scheduling, allocation, planning, packing,
  transportation, and various tree/graph problems.)
+ Comparison between evolutionary and non-evolutionary optimisation
algorithms
+ Hybrid Optimisation Algorithms

3. Hybrid Learning

+ Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks
+ Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems
+ Combinations Between Evolutionary and Reinforcement Learning
+ Combinations Between Evolutionary and Decision Tree Learning
+ Evolutionary Clustering and Unsupervised Learning
+ Genetic Programming
+ Other Hybrid Learning Systems

4. Adaptive Systems

+ Complexity in Adaptive Systems
+ Evolutionary Robotics
+ Artificial Ecology

5. Evolutionary Economics and Games

+ Analysis and Simulation in Evolutionary Economics, Finance and Marketing
+ Evolutionary Games
+ Evolutionary Computation Techniques in Economics, Finance and Marketing

6. Theoretical Issues in Evolutionary Computation 

+ Convergence and Convergence Rate of Evolutionary Algorithms
+ Computational Complexity of Evolutionary Algorithms
+ Self-Adaptation in Evolutionary Algorithms

7. Evolvable Hardware (EHW)

+ FPGA Implementation of EHW
+ Algorithms for EHW
+ EHW Systems and Chips

8. Applications

+ Novel Applications of Evolutionary Techniques
+ Optimisation Algorithms for Real-World Problems
+ Solving classical OR (Operations Research) problems by Evolutionary Algorithms
+ Pattern Classification and Recognition
+ Time-Series Prediction
+ System Identification
+ Others

Publications
------------

All accepted papers which are presented at the conference will be included
in the conference proceedings. Outstanding papers will be considered for 
inclusion in a proposed volume of Springer Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence (LNAI). Some of them will be invited to further
expand and revise their papers for inclusion in an international journal. 
(Selections from SEAL'96 papers were published by Springer-Verlag as
 Volume 1285 of LNAI.)
