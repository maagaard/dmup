	            ACM CIKM '98 Call for Papers

Seventh International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management

               November 3--7, 1998, Washington D.C., USA

	       	Sponsored by ACM SIGIR and ACM SIGMIS

CIKM'98 will bring together leading researchers and developers in a
wide variety of scientific areas, with a common interest in improving
information and knowledge management technologies.  Its objective is
to provide a forum for the discussion and dissemination of recent
advances in the area, and to foster collaboration between the
database, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence
communities.

The focus of the conference is new and original research results in
the areas of theoretical foundations, design, implementation, and
applications of information and knowledge management.  We solicit
papers that address novel, challenging and innovative results.  We
also solicit short papers that challenge the field with new
technologies or applications and open new horizons of research.
Suggested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

Intelligent Search and Data Mining	
Data Cleaning and Noise Modeling 
Uncertainty Management  		
Data Mining Methods 
Automated Discovery Agents 		
Privacy and Security Issues 
Interactive Data Exploration 		
Knowledge and Resource Discovery 
Multimedia  Database Systems 		
Mobile Databases and Wireless Computing
Digital Libraries 
Information Representation and Modeling
Modeling Database Dynamics  
Information Structures and Interaction 
Hypertext and Hypermedia 
Distributed Object Management
Query Languages Transaction and Workflow Management  
Data and Knowledge Sharing 
Heterogeneous and Distributed Systems
High Performance Algorithms 
Design Techniques for Object Databases 
Intelligent Agents and Network Mediators
Temporal/Spatial Databases
Active and Extensible Databases
Engineering, Scientific and Design Databases 
Intelligent Information Systems 
User and Application Interfaces  
Time, Event and Change Management and Monitoring 
Dynamic Databases 
Tuning, Benchmarking and Performance 
New Experimental, Commercial and Educational Systems 
Integrating Databases and Information Retrieval 
Cooperating and Interoperable Federated Systems  
Parallelism and Distribution  
Object Storage and Servers
Imprecise and Uncertain Information 

Authors are invited to submit complete and original papers. Papers
that may be submitted for consideration include those that have not
previously been published in another forum, or are not currently being
published or reviewed by another journal or conference.  All submitted
papers will be refereed for quality, originality and relevance.  Of
particular interest are papers which address experiences with concrete
applications.  All accepted papers will appear in the conference
proceedings, to be published by ACM Press, provided at least one
author attends the conference to present the paper.

Manuscripts should include an abstract and be limited to 5000 words.
Submissions should include the title, author(s), author's affiliation,
e-mail address, tel/fax numbers and postal address.  In case of
multiple authors, please indicate which author is responsible for
correspondence and preparing the camera ready paper for the
proceedings.  Seven copies of the manuscript should be submitted by
May 1, 1998 to either of the Program Co-Chairs:

Dr. James French		Dr. Georges Gardarin
c/o CIKM'98 (IR track) 		CIKM'98 (DBMS track)
Computer Science Department 	PRiSM  Laboratory (& INRIA)
University of Virginia 		University of Versailles SQ
Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA	78035 Versailles Cedex, France
french@cs.virginia.edu 		georges.gardarin@prism.uvsq.fr
804-982-2213 			33 1 39254054/56

Authors will be notified of acceptance by the end of June, and
camera-ready copies for the proceedings will be due the end of August.
