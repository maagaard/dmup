CONNECTIONIST APPROACHES IN ECONOMICS
 AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL MEETING

COMPLEX DATA: MODELING AND ANALYSIS

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


Since the beginning of the 80s, important advances have been made in
developing diverse new approaches of bio-mimetic inspiration (neural nets,
genetic algorithms, cellular automata.) These approaches are of prime
interest for researcher both in Economics and in Management Sciences. The
ACSEG  International Meetings give the opportunity to assess the
state-of-the-art in the domain, to delineate future developments, and to
evidence the contribution of bio-mimetic methods to Economics and Management
Sciences. They also allow the researchers to present their recent work, to
exchange know-how, and to discuss the problems encountered in their
research.

The 1998 ASCEG International Meeting on Complex Data  Modeling and Analysis
Will take place at the Universite catholique de Louvain, November 20, 1998.
Organizers are the research centers SAMOS (Universite de Paris 1 -
Pantheon - Sorbonne), CEGF (Universite catholique de Louvain) and CeReFim
(Facultes Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix).
