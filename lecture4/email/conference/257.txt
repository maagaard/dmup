Dear Colleague,

On the behalf of the organizing committee I am glad to announce the
IEEE-INNS-ENNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks
IJCNN'2000, to be held at the Grand Hotel Cernobbio, Como, Italy, on
24-27 July 2000. The conference is organized and sponsored by the IEEE
Neural Network Council, with the cooperation with the International
Neural Network Society and the European Neural Network Society.

The preliminary call for papers can be found at the conference web site
http://www.ims.unico.it/2000ijcnn.html

All information about the conference will be posted there. No printed
mailing will be done this year: very few emailing will be also done to
avoid bothering you.  Therefore, stay tuned on the above web site!

If any colleague or student of yours like to be included in this
emailing list, please forward her/him this message: instructions to
subscribe the list are attached below.

Other events will be organized before and after the conference: they
will be announced soon.

Ciao and see you in Como!


Vincenzo Piuri
IJCNN'2000 Program Co-Chair for Europe
