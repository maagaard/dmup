            Italian Conference on the Linux Operating System

                           Call for Papers


Aims and Scope of the Conference
--------------------------------

Linux, an operating system initially designed by a finnish student, and
now developed by hundreds of programmers from all over the world
communicating over the Internet, has made out of the group of its fans and
gained a firm place next to commercial operating systems.

An ever growing number of applications, free and commercial, is being
written or ported to Linux. Today, Linux is used for tasks where a few
years ago costly systems were necessary. 

Furthermore, the open development model makes Linux highly valuable in the
teaching context: one can study the internals of this operating system,
modify them and submit an enhanced version of the Operating System to the
rest of the Linux users' community, thus contributing to the development
of the system itself. 

Aim of this conference is giving a wide-scope picture of the Linux
landscape for those who wish to approach it, and specific technical
information to experienced users.
