                               Palais des Congrès
                            Montréal, Québec, Canada

Call for Papers

GI 2000 is a unique event that presents the latest results in computer 
graphics and human-computer interaction.  It offers three days of Invited 
Speakers, Posters, and Submitted Papers.  A Banquet and Electronic Theatre 
provide additional opportunities to meet speakers and other attendees for 
informal discussion in a social setting.  This conference is sponsored by 
Canadian Human-Computer Communications Society.

This year will be the 26th annual Graphics Interface. It is the oldest 
regularly scheduled computer graphics and human-computer interface conference 
in the world. Graphics Interface has established a reputation for a 
high-quality technical program, and the excellence of its invited speakers. 
Full details are on the GI 2000 web site (http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gi2000) 

GI 2000 will be held at the Palais des Congrès, Montréal, Québec, Canada, 
in conjunction with four other conferences: AI 2000 (Artificial Intelligence), 
VI 2000 (Vision Interface), 10th annual PRECARN-IRIS (Institute for Robotics 
and Intelligent Systems), and ISR 2000 (31st International Symposium on 
Robotics). This special joint event offers a unique opportunity to broaden 
dissemination of the scientific results and to foster the exchange of 
expertise across adjacent research fields. To promote these exchanges, all 
attendees will have access to the presentations of these parallel conferences,
as well as to the following exhibitions: Robotics of Tomorrow Exhibition, 
the Montreal Fabricating and Machine Tool Show, and the National Factory 
Automation Show. 

Montréal is a lively Canadian city located on an island in the St. Lawrence 
River. It is well connected by all major international airlines. Its four 
universities, several research institutes, world class technologies industry,
theatres, and museums have contributed to its international reputation as a 
dynamic business, scientific, and cultural center. With a population 
representing 80 ethnic groups, Montréal is known for its "joie de vivre"!
