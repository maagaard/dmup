Dear Colleague,


The international conference on computational intelligence for modelling,
control and automation will be held in Vienna, Austria on 17-19 February
1999. The conference provides a medium for the exchange of ideas between
theoreticians and practitioners to address the important issue in
computational intelligence, modelling, control and automation.

Please find attached a copy of the call for papers for the CIMCA'99. We
hope that you can contribute to CIMCA'99. 


Yours sincerely
CIMCA'99 Secretariat

                            SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS


The international conference on computational Intelligence for modelling,
control and automation will be held in Vienna, Austria on 17-19 February
1999. The conference provides a medium for the exchange of ideas between
theoreticians and practitioners to address the important issue in
computational intelligence, modelling, control and automation.

The conference will consist of both plenary sessions and contributory
sessions, focusing on theory, implementation and applications of
computational intelligence techniques to modelling, control and automation.
For contributory sessions, extended abstract papers are being solicited.
Several well-known keynote speakers will address the conference. Topics
include, but are not limited to, the following area:

Modern and Advanced Control Strategies:
Neural Networks Control,  Fuzzy Logic Control, Genetic Algorithms &
Evolutionary Control,  Model-Predictive Control, Adaptive and Optimal
Control, Intelligent Control Systems, Robotics and Automation, Fault
Diagnosis, Intelligent agents, Industrial Automations

Hybrid Systems:

Neural Genetic Systems, Neural-Fuzzy-Genetic Systems, Hybrid Systems for
Optimisation

Data Analysis, Prediction and Model Identification:
Signal Processing, Prediction & Time Series Analysis, System
Identification, Data Fusion and Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery,
Intelligent Information Systems, Image Processing, Image Understanding,
Parallel Computing applications in Identification & Control, Pattern
Recognition, Clustering, Classification

Decision Making and Information Retrieval:
Case-Based Reasoning, Decision Analysis, Intelligent Databases &
Information Retrieval, Dynamic Systems Modelling, Decision Support Systems,
Multi-criteria Decision Making, Qualitative and Approximate-Reasoning
Modelling


Paper Submission

Papers will be selected based on their originality, significance,
correctness, and clarity of presentation. Four copies of extended abstract
(500-800 word) should be submitted to the following address:

CIMCA'99 Secretariat
