CALL FOR PAPERS
Papers must be received by 16 April 1999. They will be reviewed by
senior researchers in the field and the authors will be informed about
the decision of the review process in July 1999. The accepted
papers must be submitted in a camera-ready format by 31 August. All
accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press. As
the conference is a multi-disciplinary meeting the papers are required
to be comprehensible to a wider rather than to a very specialised
audience. Papers will be presented at the conference either in an oral
or in a poster session. Please submit five copies of the paper
written in English on A4-format white paper with 2.5 cm margins on
all four sides, in two column format, on not more than 6 pages,
single-spaced, in Times or similar font of 10 points, and printed on
one side of the page only. Centred at the top of the first page should
be the complete title, author(s), mailing and e-mailing addresses,
followed by an abstract and the text. In the covering letter the
stream and the topic of the paper according to the list above should
be indicated. The IEEE Transaction journals LaTex article style can be
used. 

SPECIAL ISSUES OF JOURNALS AND EDITED VOLUMES
Selected papers will be published in special issues of scientific
journals. The organising committee is looking for publications of
edited volumes which include chapters covering the conference topics
written by invited conference participants. 

TUTORIALS (16 November)
Conference tutorials will be organized to introduce the basics of
cognitive modelling, dynamical systems, neural networks, fuzzy
systems, evolutionary programming, soft computing, expert systems,
hybrid systems, and adaptive systems. Proposals for tutorials are due
on 15 March 1999. 

EXHIBITION
Companies and university research laboratories are encouraged to
exhibit their developed or distributing software and hardware systems. 

STUDENT SESSION
Postgraduate students are encouraged to submit papers to this session
following the same formal requirements for paper submission. The
submitted papers will be published in a separate brochure. 

VENUE (Perth) 
The Conference will be held in Perth city. The closing session will be
held on Saturday, 20 November at a scenic bush location following an
outdoor seafood barbecue. 

ACCOMMODATION
Accommodation has been booked at the conference venue, and in the
numerous Hotels nearby suitable for a range of budgets. Please see
the web site for details after the paper deadline date. 

POSTCONFERENCE EVENTS
The ICONIP'99 post conference workshop and expo on "Future Directions
for Intelligent Information Processing Systems" will be held in
Dunedin, New Zealand from 22-23 November 1999. Please see the workshop
homepage http://divcom.otago.ac.nz/infosci/kel/iconip99-workshop.htm.
An affiliated post-conference workshop is the third Australia-Japan
joint Workshop on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems will be held in
Canberra, Australia from 22-23 November 1999. Please see the workshop
homepage http://www.cs.adfa.edu.au/conference/aj99/
