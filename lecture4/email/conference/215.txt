The IEEE International Conference on Information, Intelligence, and Systems
(ICIIS) offers theoretical and practical media for the constructive interaction
among scientists and practitioners from different research fields
(computers, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, chemistry,
engineering, etc) having as goals the development of methodologies and
tools for the solution of complex problems in neuroscience and
biology, automation and robotics, image, speech and natural languages,
and their integration. The conference is organized as four simultaneous
single-track symposia.
