MODERN SCIENCE AND THE MIND(MSM) is an online non-credit course
which will be presented during the coming semester by the Center for
Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona.

Specifically designed for the general public, MSM examines salient aspects
of current physical, biological, cognitive, and social sciences to provide
a sound basis for evaluating the role of science in consciousness studies.
Participants are encouraged to appreciate the immense intricacy of real
biological, social and mental phenomena, moving beyond sweeping theoretical
formulations toward a balanced understanding of what science may be able to
contribute to current discussions of the body, the brain, and the mind.

MSM is organized around fifteen "presentations" of about 5000 words each,
which are written in a lively and reader friendly style that avoids
technical jargon. These presentations feature many links to related web
sites, enabling participants to gain a broad appreciation for the scope of
current activities in modern consciousness science.

MSM will run for fifteen weeks, from 17 January 2000 through 8 May 2000,
with a week off for the Tucson 2000 conference. One presentation will be
posted on the web each Monday, together with independent contributions from
a distinguished selection of "commentators". Throughout the week,
participants are encouraged to interact with the commentators, the "course
leader", and among themselves on topics related to the presentations.
