Subject: ICCIN'98: Student funding available, deadline: August 1
Status: RO
X-Status: 

		   3rd International Conference on

	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE (ICCIN'98)

	     Sheraton Imperial Hotel & Convention Center
		Research Triangle Park, North Carolina
	  October 24-28, 1998 (Tutorials are on October 23)

	 New Deadline for Student Paper Submissions: August 1
		   ARO Financial Support Available

The organizers of ICCIN '98 and the Joint Conference on Information
Sciences are pleased to announce that the Mathematical and Computer
Sciences Division of the Army Research Office has become a sponsor of
JCIS'98. Registration and travel stipends for students with accepted
papers to ICCIN '98 and JCIS'98 will be made available.

To accommodate this late breaking good news, the deadline for student
papers to ICCIN '98 and JCIS '98 will be extended to August 1,
1998. All papers will undergo rapid peer review.  A student paper
constitutes a paper with significant student involvement; it need not
be a paper where the student is the first or primary author. For the
purposes of this announcement, "students" include, but are not limited
to grad students, post-docs and research fellows.

Some funds may be available for students who wish to attend the
conference but who do not present research findings.  However,
preference will be given to those students actually presenting
research findings on work in computational intelligence, neural
networks, control and systems theory and other topics relevant to the
JCIS '98.

Students who have already submitted papers and would like to be
considered for funding please send a note to georgiou@csci.csusb.edu .
