                        6th International Workshop

                         Fuzzy-Neuro Systems '99


Fuzzy-Neuro Systems `99 is the sixth event of a well established series
of workshops with international participation. Its aim is to give an
overview of the state of the art in research and development of fuzzy
systems and artificial neural networks. Another aim is to highlight
applications of these methods and to forge innovative links between
theory and application by means of creative discussions.

Fuzzy-Neuro Systems `99 is being organized by the Research Committee 1.2
"Inference Systems" (Fachausschuss 1.2 "Inferenzsysteme") of the German
Society of Computer Science GI (Gesellschaft für Informatik e. V.) and
Universität Leipzig, March 18 - 19, 1999

Workshop Chairs: Gerhard Brewka and Siegfried Gottwald
Local Organization: Ralf Der and Andreas Schierwagen

Topics of interest include:

theory and principles of multivalued logic and fuzzy logic
representation of fuzzy knowledge
approximate reasoning
fuzzy control in theory and practice
fuzzy logic in data analysis, signal processing and pattern recognition
fuzzy classification systems
fuzzy decision support systems
fuzzy logic in non-technical areas like business administration,
	management etc.
fuzzy databases
theory and principles of artificial neural networks
hybrid learning algorithms
neural networks in pattern recognition, classification, process
	monitoring and production control
theory and principles of evolutionary algorithms: genetic algorithms and
	evolution strategies
discrete parameter and structure optimization
hybrid systems like neuro-fuzzy systems, connectionist expert systems
	etc.
special hardware and software

Submissions should be extended abstracts of 4-6 pages. Please send 5
copies of your contribution to Gerhard Brewka, Universität Leipzig,
Institut für Informatik, Augustusplatz 10-11, 04109 Leipzig, Germany.
Proceedings containing full versions of accepted papers will be
published.

Preliminary schedule:


      Submission of papers: Nov. 8th, 1998
      Notification of authors: Dec. 15th, 1998
      Final version of accepted papers: Jan. 16th, 1999
      Workshop: March 18-19, 1999

The conference language will be English.
