    ******CALL FOR PARTICIPATION/INVITATION******

On behalf of Proferssor Tom Gedeon, chairman of ICONIP'99,
we are looking for INVITED SPEAKERS  to participate in a (or a series
of) special session(s) discussing  "Neural Information Coding" for
this years' International Conference  on Neural Information Processing
ICONIP'99 to be held in Perth, Australia November 16-20.

                ************** NOTE ***************

           TRAVEL RE-EMBURSEMENTS CAN NOT BE PROVIDED

                ************** NOTE ***************

Neural information coding or the neural code, is still today a subject
full of mystery and controversy. To date, there are several main
stream contender neural codes (such as temporal and population coding)
each with their own supporting experimental evidence.

This has inevitably led to some confusion and differences in opinion,
as to how information is encoded and processed with a "biological
brain".  Even though some progress has been made in solving the neural
code, it is still not a popular discussion issue which definitely
needs further debate and wider recognition, especially in the neural
network community.

Further benefits, especially those living in the upper Northern
hemisphere (Europe, US and Canada), will be that since the conference
is held near the end of spring, it will be a great opportunity to
escape the cold winter and do some sight-seeing in Perth or around
Australia, where one can witness truely unique natural wilderness.

There are TWO CHOICES of presentation format, you the invitee can give
either

    A) a normal paper presentation of about 20 minutes duration or
    B) a panel discussion style (and can still have a paper for the
       proceedings)

It would be greatly appreciated if you definitely confirm your
attendence to ICONIP'99 ASAP and furthermore, please indicate which
style of presentation you prefer.

Please send all correspondence to

       nicolang@yugiri.riken.go.jp or if this fails use
       angelo@postman.riken.go.jp


Yours sincerely,



Nicolangelo Iannella
