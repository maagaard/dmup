*********************************************************************
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION VISUALISATION

Visualisation of data and information has led to a convergence in the
use of computing among various disciplines.  The diversity and
complexity of information and its applications has consequently
created a domain of erosion of boundaries between information users
and information originators.  This revolution has in turn created new
contexts, needs, and potential for interaction between users and
information.  Now the core question is, how will humankind tame this
boundless potential?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
THEME The theme chosen for this conference is "A PROGRESS TOWARDS
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE".  IV'98 conference aims to focus on the
interdisciplinary methods and affiliated research done among various
science disciplines, medicine, engineering, media and commerce.  This
three day event will focus on the research and developments conjured
to meet the roaring demand of today's "Information Transfer" through
the medium of computing,  accentuating on the linkage that shapes
academia and industry with the goal of stimulating views and providing
a forum where researchers and practitioners can discuss the latest
developments linked to Information Visualisation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE The conference will feature research reviews, poster papers,
workshops, keynote lectures, plenary sessions, film and computer
generated art shows, reviewing the future state of art and discussing
future directions within the domain of Information Visualisation.

The following symposia are already envisaged (but not restricted): =B7

of art that represent how new technology stretches the boundaries of
creativity even further.  All the entries for this section are
encouraged to present their work in form of a short paper accompanied
by explanatory notes not more than two A-4 size pages and those with
technical and artistic emphasis will be published in the proceedings
under short paper or poster paper section. The following themes of

Cartography - Fractal Models.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PANEL DEBATES Panel debates to address important issues in
visualisation of information from various angles of emphasis
philosophy, research, applications, systems, results and what next.
Panellists should be active and expert in their fields.  These
sessions are between 1 to 2 hours with 3 to 5 speakers.  Panel
proposals should describe the topics to be debated and identify the
prospective panellists.  Panels should be organised such that to
encourage audience participation. Each panellist should include a
position of statements on the topics with a brief biography about her
or himself.  These statements will be included in the conference
proceedings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
TUTORIAL PROPOSALS Pre-conference short courses for half- or full day
are invited for visualisation systems, methods, application areas and
other related fields.  Tutorials will take place prior to the
conference.  Proposals should identify the level of proficiencies
expected from participants at a beginner, intermediate, or advanced
levels.  You should include: an abstract of the topic, a brief
description of tutorial's organisation and time allocation for major
