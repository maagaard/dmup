Subject: I&AAN'98 Workshop
Status: RO
X-Status: 

International Workshop on
INDEPENDENCE & ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS / I&ANN'98=20
at the University of La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain
February 9-10, 1998

http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/icsc/iann98.htm


This workshop will take place immediately prior to the
International ICSC Symposium on
ENGINEERING OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS / EIS'98
at the University of La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain
February 11-13, 1998

http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/icsc/eis98.htm

TOPICS

Recent ANN research has developed from those networks which find
correlations in data sets to the more ambitious goal of finding independent
components of data sets. The workshop will concentrate on those neural
networks which find independent components and the associated networks whose
learning rules use contextual information to organize their learning.

The topic falls then into (at least) three main streams of current ANN=
 research:

1. Independent Component Analysis which has most=20
   recently been successfully applied to the problem=20
   of "blind separation of sources" such as the=20
   recovery of a single voice from a mixture/convolution=20
   of voices. Such methods normally use either=20
   information theoretic criteria or higher order=20
   statistics to perform the separation.

2. Identification of independent sources: The seminal=20
   experiment in this field is the identification of=20
   single bars from an input grid containing mixtures=20
   of bars. Factor Analysis (or generative models) has=20
   been a recent popular method for this problem.=20

3. Using contextual information to identify structure=20
   in data.

We envisage a single track program over two days (February 9 - 10, 1998)
with many opportunities for informal discussion.

INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS AND AUTHORS

Registrations are available for the workshop only (February 9 - 10, 1998),
or combined with the EIS'98 symposium (February 11 - 13, 1998).

The registration fee for the 2-day workshop is estimated at approximately
Ptas. 37,000 per person and includes:

- Use of facilities and equipment
- Lunches, dinners and coffee breaks
- Welcome wine & cheese party
- Proceedings in print (workshop only)=20
- Proceedings on CD-ROM (workshop and EIS'98 conference)
- Daily transportation between hotels in Santa Cruz and workshop site

The regular registration fee for the EIS'98 symposium (February 11-13, 1998)
is estimated at Ptas. 59,000 per person, but a reduction will be offered to
workshop participants.

Separate proceedings will be printed for the workshop, but all respective
papers will also be included on the CD-ROM, covering the I&ANN'98 workshop
and the EIS'98 symposium. As a bonus, workshop participants will thus
automatically also receive the conference proceedings (CD-ROM version). We
anticipate that the proceedings will be published as a special issue of a
journal.

******************************************


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are requested to send a 4-6 page report of their work
for evaluation by the International Scientific Committee. All reports must
be written in English, starting with a succinct statement of the problem,
the results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous=
 work.=20

The report should also include:

- Title of workshop (I&ANN'98)
- Title of proposed paper
- Authors names, affiliations, addresses
- Name of author to contact for correspondence
- E-mail address and fax # of contact author
- Topics which best describe the paper (max. 5 keywords)
