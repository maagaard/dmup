ANNOUNCEMENT / CALL FOR PAPERS

International ICSC Symposium on

ENGINEERING OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
EIS'98

February 11 - 13, 1998

at the University of La Laguna
Tenerife, Spain=20

*********************************


PURPOSE OF THE SYMPOSIUM

In recent years, the applications of Artificial Intelligence have been
extended thanks to the development of new fields, such as Neural Networks,
Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms. The possibility of accurate modeling of
complex problems permitted by those new tools allow to approach new
applications of artificial intelligence in control theory, robotics, signal
processing and even business, financial planning management, damage
assessment, security, and so on.
=20
The main aim of this conference is to bring together theorists from
different fields of artificial intelligence and people working in
applicative areas, in order to state the current state of the research and
applications of Intelligent Systems and make the basis for rewarding
cooperation in the area.

Contributions are sought in areas based on the list below, which is
indicative only. Contributions from new application areas will be
particularly welcome.

*********************************


SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

EIS'98 will include invited plenary talks, contributed sessions, invited
sessions, workshops and demonstrations. Various projects are in preparation,
respectively under consideration. Please consult the EIS'98 Web Site for
full updated information.

Anyone wishing to organize a session or discussion, is requested to contact
the general chairman or the symposium organizer before August 31, 1997.

*********************************


INVITED SESSIONS

Prospective organizers of invited sessions are requested to send a session
proposal (consisting of 4-5 invited paper abstracts, the recommended
session-chair and co-chair, as well as a short statement describing the
title and the purpose of the session) to the Symposium Chairman or the
Symposium Organizer. All invited sessions should start with a tutorial=
 paper.

*********************************


DEMONSTRATION SESSIONS

Instead of submitting a paper, proposals for a 20 minute demonstration of a
practical application can also be submitted. The proposal should follow the
abstract submission guidelines. Only the abstract of the demonstration will
be included in the conference proceedings.

*********************************


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are requested to send an abstract of 500 words for
review by the International Scientific Committee. All abstracts must be
written in English, starting with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous work. If
authors believe that more details are necessary to substantiate the main
claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix that will be
read at the discretion of the International Scientific Committee.

The abstract should also include:

- Title of conference (EIS'98)
- Title of proposed paper
- Authors names, affiliations, addresses
- Name of author to contact for correspondence
- E-mail address and fax # of contact author
- Topics which best describe the paper (max. 5 keywords)

Contributions are welcome from those working in industry and having
experience in the topics of this conference as well as from academics. The
conference language is English. Tutorial papers and demonstrations are also
encouraged.

It is recommended to submit abstracts by electronic mail (ASCII text) to

icsc@compusmart.ab.ca=20

or else by fax or mail (2 copies) to the following address:

*********************************


CONFERENCE LOCATION

Tenerife, known worldwide as the everspring island, is a volcanic island
originated in the Tertiary. It looks like a triangle and covers an area of
2,057 square kilometers. Its orography is complex and abrupt. In the North
Eastern part an impressive mountainous range divides the island in two steep
slopes. Actually, one of the most peculiar characteristics of Tenerife is
the contrast between the North and the South: The North being evergreen and
quite humid and the South dry and extremely sunny. Tenerife's special
situation and the incidence of a number of favorable factors, such as the
constant caress of the westerly winds, keep the mean temperature mild and
most agreeable throughout the year.

*********************************


SOCIAL ACTIVITIES

The social program (also available for accompanying persons) features an
excursion to the most beautiful spots on the island, including a special
dinner and entertainment.

*********************************


IMPORTANT DATES AND DEADLINES

- Submission of abstracts: May 31, 1997
- Notification of acceptance: August 31, 1997
- Delivery of full papers: October 31, 1997
- Symposium: February 11 - 13, 1997
