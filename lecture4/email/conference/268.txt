FOR THE UPCOMING EIGHTH ANNUAL COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE MEETING (CNS*99)

                                                     July 18 - 22, 1999
                                               Pittsburgh, Pennsylavania


We have just learned that travel grants for students and postdoctoral
fellows will be available for the upcoming CNS meeting.

While priority for support will go to those who are listed as authors on
CNS papers, we anticipate also being able to support some graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows who want to attend the meeting without presenting
a paper.

Information on the meeting agenda, registration, etc can be found at:
http://cns.numedeon.com/cns99/


Please note that conference rates at the hotel and assured room
availability require that you make reservations at
the Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers BEFORE JUNE 17th.

Please contact the hotel directly for reservations and make sure and
mention that you are attending CNS*99.

The Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers:   (412) 391-4600
