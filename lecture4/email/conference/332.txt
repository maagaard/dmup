   ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

          -----------------------------------
          4TH ANNUAL MEETING: CALL FOR PAPERS
          -----------------------------------

               THE UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS:
          BINDING, INTEGRATION, AND DISSOCIATION

                Universite Libre de Bruxelles
          JUNE 29th - JULY 2nd, 2000: BRUSSELS,BELGIUM


Brussels, November 8, 1999

The fourth meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study 

of Consciousness will be held from June 29th to July 2nd, 

2000, at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Brussels, Belgium) 

on the theme of "The Unity of Consciousness".

Consciousness has many elements, from sensory experiences 

such as vision, audition, and bodily sensation, to nonsensory 

aspects such as volition, emotion, memory, and thought. The 

apparent unity of these elements is striking: all are presented 

to us as experiences of a single subject, and all seem to be 

contained within a unified field of experience. But this 

apparent unity raises many questions. How do diverse systems in 

the brain co-operate to produce a unified experience?Are there 

conditions under which this unity breaks down? And is conscious 

experience really unified at all?
In recent years, these questions have been addressed 

by researchers in many fields. Neurophysiologists and 

computational modelers have investigated the mechanisms by 

which binding and integration of disparate information may take 

place in the brain, producing a unified experience. 

Neuropsychological research has documented a large variety
of dissociation disorders in which damage to specific 

brain regions leads to dissociated experiences, suggesting the 

apparent disintegration of a unified subject. Cognitive 

psychologists have investigated the role of attention and 

learning in the integration of information, and have
examined conditions under which perception and action, or 

subjective experience and behavior, can become dissociated. 

Some cognitive modelers have suggested that unity is a mere 

illusion, while others have emphasized the role of a central 

unifying system in integrating sensory and motor experience. 

And philosophers have analyzed just what the unity of 

consciousness comes to, and whether we have reason to believe 

that it exists.

The fourth ASSC conference will bring together 

researchers from numerous disciplines to discuss these issues. 

Topics that will be addressed include:

- the role of synchronous oscillations in binding and 

integration
- other neurophysiological mechanisms for integration 

of information
- computational models of binding, integration, and 

unity
- neuropsychological disorders with dissociation of 

experience
- the role of attention and learning in unification of 

experience
- dissociations between perceptual systems
- implicit vs. explicit aspects of knowledge and 

learning
- dissociations between perception, thought, and 

action
- the relationship between information integration and 

unified experience
- analysis of the concept of unity
- unification of consciousness and self across time
- the existence or nonexistence of unified 

consciousness

Confirmed plenary speakers include: Rodney Cotterill, 

Zoltan Dienes,Andreas Engel, Glyn Humphreys, Susan Hurley, 

Pierre Perruchet, Randy O'Reilly, Sydney Shoemaker, Catherine 

Tallon-Baudry, Giulio Tononi,Ann Treisman, Andrew Young, and 

Semir Zeki.


         -------------------------
         CALL FOR PAPERS & POSTERS
         -------------------------

While the central theme of ASSC4 is "The unity of 

consciousness", and plenary sessions will deal largely with 

this theme, speakers in concurrent sessions are invited to talk 

on any topic relevant to the scientific study of consciousness. 

Submissions that include physiological, psychological, 

philosophical, and computational perspectives are all welcome.

Submissions for both posters and talks will be accepted. Any 

person may present only one submission, but may be co-author on 

several. Oral presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, to 

be followed by a 10-minute discussion period.

Plenary lectures, symposia, concurrent sessions, and 

poster sessions will all be held on the Solbosch campus of the 

Universite Libre de Bruxelles.


         ---------------------------
         CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
         ---------------------------

This notice is also intended as a call for workshop 

presenters. One of the aims of this meeting is to allow 

researchers to gain a background in areas that they may know 

little about. Towards that end a number of workshops are 

planned. Is there a topic you or perhaps someone in your
laboratory might want to present? Some participants in the 

conference would be very interested in learning about technical 

matters such as fMRI or other important brain imaging 

techniques. Others might enjoy aseminar on a philosophical 

topic. If you have recently published a book or major article 

on some topic you might want to lead a discussion on
it.  As with papers the focus of all workshops should 

naturally fit within the overall theme of the conference. A 

non-exclusive list of possible topics might include:

-- The latest methods and implications of various 

brain scanning techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, SQUID, ERP)
-- Blindsight, neglect, or other neuropsychological syndromes
-- Neural network or other theoretical models of 

processing in areas related to conscious activity
-- Differences and similarities between conscious and 

unconscious processing
-- Current models of the visual system
-- Consciousness and metacognition
-- Criteria for the ascription of consciousness
-- Philosophical issues concerning unity
-- Phenomenological methods for investigating consciousness
-- Please suggest other sample topics, or modify 

the above!!

Workshops will be held in parallel sessions on the morning and
afternoon of June 29th. Each workshop is intended to last
approximately three hours. The sizes of workshops will 

vary between a minimum of 10 to a maximum of around 25 people. 

Workshops that do not achieve the minimum enrollment of 10 

people will not be offered.
Workshop presenters will receive a honorarium of 20000 

BEF. The cost of attending workshops will be 2000 BEF.
To submit workshop proposals or to suggest further 

topics, please write to Patrick Wilken at 

<patrickw@cs.monash.edu.au>.
