Graphics Hardware 2000
======================

in cooperation with Eurographics and ACM SIGGRAPH
(to be confirmed)

Interlaken, Switzerland
Monday and Tuesday, August 21-22, 2000

Graphics Hardware is a highly visible, established international forum
for exchanging experience and knowledge related to computer graphics
hardware. The workshop offers a unique perspective on graphics
hardware by combining discussions and constructive critique of
innovative concepts as well as product-level designs. The workshop is
an inclusive forum for the entire graphics hardware community and
brings together researchers, engineers, and architects. This year's
workshop will be held in Interlaken, Switzerland, jointly with
Eurographics 2000.

Schedule
--------

April 12  Deadline for paper submissions
May 8     Notification of acceptance
May 22    Camera-ready papers due
July 12   Deadline for Hot 3D Systems submissions
Aug 21-22 Workshop

Traditional Papers Track
------------------------

We invite high-quality, original papers on all aspects of computer
graphics hardware describing either proven and tested solutions or
novel ideas and concepts. Possible topics include:

    Graphics accelerator architectures
    Performance issues
    Pixel operations and frame buffer techniques
    Multi-processor architectures for graphics
    Hardware support for image-based rendering
    Load balancing in graphics systems
    Expansion and acceleration of shading models
    Volume rendering architectures
    Space, screen, and model partitioning
    Hardware support for photorealism
    Media processors
    Exploitation of new memory technologies for 3D graphics

Authors are invited to send papers electronically, in Adobe PDF format
as an email attachment, to lastra@cs.unc.edu. Please limit the length
to 10 typeset pages or 20 double-spaced pages. If electronic
submission is not feasible, please send six copies of the paper to the
address below.

If you would like to send videotapes to accompany the paper, please
make six copies and mail them to the address below. An effort should
be made to include the segment in both PAL and NTSC on the same VHS
tape, to ensure that it can be seen by all reviewers.

Submission address:

    Anselmo Lastra
    Department of Computer Science
    CB 3175, Sitterson Hall
    University of North Carolina

    Phone +919-962-1958
    FAX +919-962-1799
    Email: lastra@cs.unc.edu

If you wish to send papers electronically, but via an alternate method
such as ftp, please contact lastra@cs.unc.edu for instructions.

Hot 3D Systems Track
--------------------

We invite industry groups to present their latest and greatest 3D
chips or system designs. Presentations should be technical, rather
than marketing, and should focus on real products and their
performance evaluation. Presentations should last approximately 20-25
minutes. Bound copies of the slides will be prepared for attendees,
and presentation slides will be made available on the workshop web
page after the workshop.

Contributors are invited to send their presentation slides
electronically, in Microsoft PowerPoint format, as an email attachment
to bosch@us.ibm.com by July 12, 2000. If electronic submission is not
feasible, please send a hardcopy of the slides to the address below.

Submission address:

The Workshop
------------

The workshop will take place in Interlaken, Switzerland in a hotel
during Monday and Tuesday of Eurographics 2000 week. The workshop will
feature two full days of paper and industry presentations and invited
talks. We will continue the workshop's tradition of a sumptuous
banquet at a unique location.

Registration
------------

The registration fee (in US $) includes the workshop proceedings,
banquet, coffee, and lunches. The workshop fee does not cover
accommodations. Please see our website for full details on registration
and accommodations.

Best Paper Award
----------------

An award of $500 will be given to the authors of the paper considered
to be the outstanding paper presented at the workshop. The award is
based on the accuracy, originality, and importance of the technical
concept, the quality and readability of the manuscript, as well as the
content and delivery of the verbal presentation. To qualify for this
award, one or more of the principal authors must be enrolled at the
workshop and present the paper. The winner will be chosen by the
organizing committee based on audience feedback and will be announced
at the end of the workshop.

Demonstrations
--------------

Presenters and workshop participants are invited to bring prototypes
or products for demonstration at the workshop. Demonstrations will be
held on Monday and Tuesday during breaks and before and after workshop
sessions. We highly encourage paper authors and industry presenters to
demonstrate their systems at the workshop. Please contact the workshop
chairs to arrange for space or electrical connections that may be
required for your demonstration.
