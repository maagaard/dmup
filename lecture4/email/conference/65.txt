 International Workshop on 

  ***  ADVANCED BLACK-BOX TECHNIQUES FOR NONLINEAR MODELING:
       THEORY AND APPLICATIONS                                *** 

 with  !!!  TIME-SERIES PREDICTION COMPETITION !!!


 Date:            July 8-10, 1998
 Place:           Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
 On-line Info:    http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/sista/workshop/

 Organized at the Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT-SISTA) and the 
 Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Networks (ICNN) in the framework of the 
 project KIT and the Belgian Interuniversity Attraction Pole IUAP P4/02.
 In cooperation with the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.


 * GENERAL SCOPE

   The rapid growth of the field of neural networks, fuzzy systems
   and wavelets is offering a variety of new techniques for modeling
   of nonlinear systems in the broad sense. These topics have been 
   investigated from differents points of view including statistics,
   identification and control theory, approximation theory, signal
   processing, nonlinear dynamics, information theory, physics and 
   optimization theory among others. The aim of this workshop is to serve 
   as an interdisciplinary forum for bringing together specialists in these
   research disciplines. Issues related to the fundamental theory as well
   as real-life applications will be addressed at the workshop.


 * TIME-SERIES PREDICTION COMPETITION

   Within the framework of this workshop a time-series prediction 
   competition will be held. The results of the competition will be
   announced during the workshop, where the winner will be awarded.
   Participants in the competition are asked to submit their predicted
   data together with a short description and references of the 
   methods used. In order to stimulate wide participation in the 
   competition, attendance of the workshop is not mandatory but 
   is of course encouraged. All information about this contest is available
   at http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/sista/workshop/ .
