of Neural Networks (EANN '99)

Fifth
International Conference on
Engineering Applications of Neural Networks
(EANN '99)

Warsaw, Poland 
13-15 September 1999

First Call for Papers

The conference is a forum for presenting the  latest results on 
neural network applications in technical fields.  The applications 
may be  in any engineering or technical    field, including but not 
limited to systems engineering,     mechanical  engineering, 
robotics,  process engineering,  metallurgy,  pulp   and  paper 
technology,  aeronautical engineering,  computer science,  
machine  vision,  chemistry, chemical engineering,  physics,    
electrical  engineering,  electronics, civil engineering,    
geophysical  sciences,       biomedical  systems,  and
environmental engineering.

Summaries of two pages (about 1000 words) should be sent by e-
mail. Various sessions are organised and
the responsibilities for some of the sessions have been divided to 
some extent from this year. The two page abstracts related to the 
following areas may be sent directly to the
person(s) coordinating the session. 

Control systems (E. Tulunay, etulunay@ed.eee.metu.edu.tr and A. 
Ruano, aruano@ualg.pt) 

Vision/Image processing (S. Draghici, sod@cs.wayne.edu) 

Hybrid systems (J. Fernandez de Canete, canete@ctima.uma.es 
and D. Tsaptsinos, D.Tsaptsinos@kingston.ac.uk)
