Dear all:

Here is the long-awaited information on the student-helper stipends for

EPS, FIG and to any of your 
students whom you think will be interested.

Yours,

Research students from the Copenhagen area are eligible to apply for six 
(6) available stipends which will cover room and board and 
full conference fees for the BRAIN AND SELF WORKSHOP: TOWARD A SCIENCE OF 
CONSCIOUSNESS to be held at the LO-Skolen in Elsinore from 
August 21-24, 1997.

In exchange for receiving these stipends, the six students will be 
required to work as conference assistants under the entire BRAIN AND SELF 
CONFERENCE, including the BRAIN AND SELF SYMPOSIUM in Copenhagen from 
August 18-20 and the BRAIN AND SELF WORKSHOP in ELsinore.  This work will 
involve technical assistance and assistance to conference participants

attendance at one planning meeting will be required.

The form of the application is as follows.
