The workshop provides a setting for discussions and constructive critique of
new ideas and novel approaches to problems in graphics hardware.

The workshop this year will be colocated with Siggraph 97 in Los Angeles.
It will take place at the Omni Hotel in L.A. the Sunday and Monday of 
Siggraph week.  There will be two days of paper presentations with ample 
time for discussions during coffee breaks, lunch, and the workshop banquet
