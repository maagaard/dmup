Fourth International Conference on
Knowledge-Based Intelligent Engineering Systems & Allied Technologies
(http://www.eng.bton.ac.uk/eee/research/kes2000/)
30 August-1 September 2000 - University of Brighton, Sussex, U.K.

Special Session on :
FUSION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
Architectures and Applications

Call For Papers

The special session aims to cover recent practical applications in the
fusion of various Intelligent techniques such as, fuzzy, neural or
genetic algorithms, or in combination with intelligent agents.

The session also covers recent advances in knowledge-based multisensor
or Information fusion architectures using a hybrid of various
Intelligent techniques, in the practical areas such as for example
landmine detection, target recognition, multispectral image fusion or
other image fusion applications.

Topics of the Special Session cover, but are not limited to:

* Fusion of sensors using Intelligent techniques in areas such as target
detection, landmines.
* Combining the use of any Intelligent Agent technology / Fuzzy /Neural /
and Genetic Algorithms to produce novel hybrid architectures used in
practical applications
* Multisensor Data Fusion architectures in practical applications using
Intelligent techniques.
* Image or Information Fusion using Intelligent techniques or Agent
technology.
* Multispectral fusion of Images or GIS Information using Knowledge-based
techniques.
