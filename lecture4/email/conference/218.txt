Conference submissions are invited that deal with all aspects of cognitive
science.  Submissions are especially encouraged that focus on an evaluation
of its achievements and/or on an exploration of promising future research
directions.

Submissions should comprise a one page extended abstract.  The conference
will have a single stream, involving just oral presentations.

We strongly encourage submissions by e-mail as ASCII or postscript
