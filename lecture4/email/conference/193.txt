	Neurophysics and Physiology of the Motor System

	 Les Houches (France), February, 7-12, 1999


Les Houches school is located in a well known ski resort
near Chamonix (in the french Alps). It  has been for more than forty years
a highly prestigious institution for physicists all over the world.
The present session will be the first to be ever dedicated, 
at Les Houches, to integrated Neurosciences.   It will bring 
together physiologists and physicists, who will discuss 
recent experimental and theoretical advances on the structure, 
dynamics and functions of the motor system. It will provide a unique 
opportunity for the participants to become familiar with many of the 
fundamental issues related to the elaboration, the execution and the 
control of movement in the central nervous system. It will also bring 
to light how Neurophysics can contribute to understanding the motor 
system. Among the topics discussed will be: emerging functional 
properties, the role of the nonlinearities of neural dynamics, the
synchrony of neural activity. These questions will be introduced in 
the framework of the different nervous structures involved (cortex, 
cerebellum, basal ganglia, spinal cord), and further discussed in 
the wider context of the integrated physiology of the motor system.
Mornings (8:30 AM to 11:30 AM) and late afternoons (5:00 PM to
7:15 PM) will be devoted to lectures.

Les Houches is a resort village in the Chamonix valley of the French Alps.
Established in 1951, the School is located in a group of mountain chalets
surrounded by meadows and woods at an altitude of 1150 m. It is above the
village, facing the Mont-Blanc range.

Registration fees are 2200FF including accommodation and meals during the
whole session. Number of participants is limited to 40, speakers included.
The participation of students and young scientists is encouraged, and they may
benefit from reduced fees (limited number).
