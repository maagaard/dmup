FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE AND NEURAL SYSTEMS
Tutorials: May 24, 2000
Meeting: May 25-27, 2000

Boston University
677 Beacon Street
Boston, Massachusetts 02215
http://cns-web.bu.edu/meetings/

Sponsored by Boston University's
Center for Adaptive Systems
and
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems

This interdisciplinary conference has drawn about 300 people from around
the world each time that it has been offered. Last year's conference was
attended by scientists from 30 countries. The conference is structured to
facilitate intense communication between its participants, both in the
formal sessions and during its other activities. As during previous years,
the millennium conference will focus on solutions to the fundamental
questions:

How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence?

The conference will include invited tutorials and lectures, and
contributed lectures and posters by experts on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a
changing world. The conference is aimed at researchers and students of
computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science,
artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial
intelligence.

A single oral or poster session enables all presented work to be
highly visible.

Abstract submissions encourage submissions of the latest results.

Costs are kept at a minimum without compromising the quality of
meeting handouts and social events.

                              * other

Contributed abstracts must be received, in English, by January 28,
2000. Notification of acceptance will be provided by email by February

Information for details. The fee will be returned if the Abstract is
not accepted for presentation and publication in the meeting
proceedings. Registration fees of accepted abstracts will be returned
on request only until April 14, 2000.

Each Abstract should fit on one 8.5" x 11" white page with 1" margins
on all sides, single-column format, single-spaced, Times Roman or
similar font of 10 points or larger, printed on one side of the page
only. Fax submissions will not be accepted. Abstract title, author
name(s), affiliation(s), mailing, and email address(es) should begin
each Abstract. An accompanying cover letter should include: Full title
of Abstract; corresponding author and presenting author name, address,
telephone, fax, and email address; and a first and second choice from
among the topics above, including whether it is biological (B) or
technological (T) work. Example: first choice: vision (T); second
choice: neural system models (B).  (Talks will be 15 minutes
long. Posters will be up for a full day. Overhead, slide, and VCR
facilities will be available for talks.)  Abstracts which do not meet
these requirements or which are submitted with insufficient funds will
be returned. Accepted Abstracts will be printed in the conference
proceedings volume. No longer paper will be required. The original and
3 copies of each Abstract should be sent to: Cynthia Bradford, Boston
University, Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, 677 Beacon
Street, Boston, MA 02215.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Early registration is recommended.  To
register, please fill out the registration form below.  Student
registrations must be accompanied by a letter of verification from a
department chairperson or faculty/research advisor. If accompanied by
an Abstract or if paying by check, mail to the address above.  If
paying by credit card, mail as above, or fax to (617) 353-7755, or
email to cindy@cns.bu.edu. The registration fee will help to pay for a
reception, 6 coffee breaks, and the meeting proceedings.

STUDENT FELLOWSHIPS: Fellowships for PhD candidates and postdoctoral
fellows may be available to cover meeting travel and living costs. 
This will be confirmed one way or the other, and broadly advertised if 
confirmed, before the deadline to apply for fellowship support, which 
will be January 28, 2000.  Applicants will be notified by email by 
February 29, 2000. Each application should include the applicant's CV, 
including name; mailing address; email address; current student status;
faculty or PhD research advisor's name, address, and email address; 
relevant courses and other educational data; and a list of research 
articles. A letter from the listed faculty or PhD advisor on official 
institutional stationery should accompany the application and summarize 
how the candidate may benefit from the meeting. Students who also submit 
an Abstract need to include the registration fee with their Abstract.  
Fellowship checks will be distributed after the meeting.
