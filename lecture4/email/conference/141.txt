    ABSTRACT: Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were
    inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics,
    and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on
    principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In
    addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable,
    because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual
    systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the
    contexts of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During
    perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up
    patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down
    manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to
    implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of
    perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not
    at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of
    selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components
    are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual
    memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become
    organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that
    produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of
    purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory
    experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g.,
    lift, run) and for introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy,
    hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic
    conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and
    produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support
    productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing
    a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from
    integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce
    complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to
    perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract
    concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and
    introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can
    implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding what it
    is becoming increasingly apparent would be problems for amodal symbol
    systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution,
    development, and artificial intelligence are explored.
