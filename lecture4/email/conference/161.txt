PURPOSE OF THE CONGRESS

Manufacturing for the Millennium The emphasis of this congress is on bringing researchers and industry closer together and endeavor to highlight the importance of both theoretical and applied research in the light of new shifts in the global economy. The continuous exchange of  scientific and technical information is of particular importance in a time of worldwide challenges in the  manufacturing industry. The impact of other rapidly changing industries such as microelectronics, automation, computer/information engineering and environmental protection is evolving new philosophies in manufacturing. The congress, to be held every second year, is meant to be a forum for academia and industry for research and the transfer of research to practice. The previous congress held in New Zealand (WMC'97) attracted participants from 35 countries around the world.

The following symposia form part of WMC'99
