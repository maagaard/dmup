     The purpose of the Neural Computing Applications Forum (NCAF) is to
     promote widespread exploitation of neural computing technology by:
 
     ]providing a focus for neural network practitioners
     ]disseminating information on all aspects of neural computing
     ]encouraging close co-operation between industrialists and academics
 
     The Summer meeting will be hosted by
         --------------
 
     Rolls-Royce in Derby, UK,
      on Tuesday 30th June and Wednesday 1st July.

     organisation will be Rolls-Royce. This is the home for the current
     NCAF chairman, Peter Cowley. His team is arguably the leading UK
     industrial group in the application of Neural and other AI techniques.
 
 
     The 2 days will be packed with applications oriented papers as usual.
     There will also be adequate time for networking with other
     practitioners, during coffee, lunch and the Tuesday evening
