Finally the VRML 97 printed proceedings and CD-ROM are available.
They shipped July 3, Bill Cockayne stopped me in downtown Monterey 
this evening to say that his copies arrived today.  Thank goodness!

For your browsing convenience, we have put a copy of the CD online at
NPS.  It will eventually be available at siggraph.org, meanwhile see
http://www.stl.nps.navy.mil/vrml97cd/

Papers, courses and presentations are all available there.  We will add a
more convenient online index next week.  If you have 17M of disk space
and a fast link, I recommend listening to Tony Parisi's keynote address:
http://www.stl.nps.navy.mil/vrml97cd/onsite/parisi.au
with accompanying html and vrml contained in
http://www.stl.nps.navy.mil/vrml97cd/onsite/parisi.tar

Bernie Roehl is chair of VRML 98, which will be held in Monterey
February 16-19 1998.  There are still a few positions available on the
VRML 98 committee, and Bernie will be announcing a working meeting to be 
held late in the week at SIGGRAPH.  Please consider writing a paper and 
contributing your work - the call for participation will be issued soon.
VRML 98 submission deadlines will likely be late September - no really!

Thanks again to all the many contributors who made VRML 97 such a
resounding success.  SIGGRAPH Publications Chair Stephen Spencer did
all the hard work assembling the proceedings and CD-ROM.  Finally special 
thanks to program chairs Rikk Carey and Paul Strauss for their efforts
& encouragement working with all the authors, keeping our technical 
standards wonderfully high.  

Enjoy the proceedings, folks, they're great.

all the best, Don
