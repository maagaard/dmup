 First USA-Italy Conference on Applied Neural and Cognitive Sciences

        Boston, October 3-6, 1999

The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Embassy of Italy
in Washington, has identified Applied Neural and Cognitive Sciences as
an area of strategic interest for research and development in Italy
over the next 10 to 20 years. UI-CANCS'99, which is sponsored jointly
by the Embassy of Italy and by Artificial Life, Inc., compares and
contrasts industry and research experiences in Italy and in the United
States.

UI-CANCS'99 focuses on smart sensors, intelligent robotics, and
related technologies with strong potential for industrial, medical and
other applications. Invited presentations will define the current
state-of-the-art and future developments in these fields, they will
compare and contrast scientific and technological resources in the USA
and Italy, and they will try to identify the most promising and =
effective
sectors in Italian industries and universities to be developed and
supported over the next 10 to 20 years.

UI-CANCS'99 offers a unique opportunity to present and discuss a broad
range of scientific and industrial projects within the context of
applied neural and cognitive sciences. The Conference also aims at
strengthening collaborations between the USA and Italy, and to develop
new joint projects.

We hope that this will be the first in a series of international
meetings held regularly to monitor progress in these fields, to
identify areas in need of further development support, and to offer a
meeting point between Italian and American members of industry,
academia and other organizations.
