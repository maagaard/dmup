Today really seems to be 'Conference Announcement Day 1999' !!!
This just popped into my inbox....

And, as Rod noted at lunch, this is like most of the others
that I sent in that it is in a hot country. All part of a clever
marketing plan, no doubt!!

                        ICCIMA'99
 3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence and
 Multimedia  Applications
                  23-26 September 1999, New Delhi, INDIA
            URL: http://eassun.eas.gu.edu.au/iccima99.html


The   3rd  International  Conference  on  Computational  Intelligence
 and Multimedia Applications will be held in Delhi on 23-26 September
1999.  The goals  of the conference are to promote interaction and
cross-fertilisation among different approaches to Computational
Intelligence such as artificial intelligence,  neural networks,
genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic,  etc.  and Multimedia  Technology
such  as multimedia  information  retrieval,  image indexing  and
retrieval,  virtual reality, video  conferencing,  etc.  The
conference will provide an international forum for discussion on
issues  in the  areas  of  Computational Intelligence and Multimedia
for  scientists, engineers,  researchers  and  practitioners. The
conference  will  include sessions  on theory, implementation and
applications, as well as  the  non- technical  areas  of  challenges
in education and  technology  transfer  to industry. There will be
both oral and poster sessions.
