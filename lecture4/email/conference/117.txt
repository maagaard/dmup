SEVENTH ANNUAL COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE MEETING (CNS*98)
         July 26 - 30, 1998   Santa Barbara, California

                REGISTRATION INFORMATION

************************************************************************

Registration is now open for this year's Computational Neuroscience meeting
(CNS*98).  This is the seventh in a series of annual inter-disciplinary
conferences intended to address the broad range of research approaches and
issues involved in the general field of computational neuroscience.  As in
previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and
theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists,
cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in
understanding how biological neural systems compute.  The meeting will
equally emphasize experimental,  model-based, and more abstract theoretical
approaches to understanding neurobiological computation.

The meeting in 1998 will take place at Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort in
Santa Barbara, California and include plenary, contributed, and poster
sessions.  The first session starts at 9 am, Sunday July 26th and the
meeting ends with the annual CNS banquet on Thursday evening, July 30th.
There will be no parallel sessions.  The meeting includes two half days of
informal workshops focused on current issues in computational neuroscience.
Day care will be available for children and given the beauty and
recreational interest of the area, we encourage families to attend.

LOCATION:  The meeting will take place at the Fess Parker's Double Tree
Resort in Santa Barbara, California.

MEETING ACCOMMODATIONS:  Accommodations for the meeting have been arranged
at Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort.  Information concerning reservations,
hotel accommodations, etc. are available at the meeting web site indicated
below.  A block of rooms are reserved at special rates. 30 student rate
rooms are available on a first-come-first-served basis, so we recommend
students acting quickly to reserve these slots.  NOTE that registering for
the meeting, WILL NOT result in an automatic room reservation.  Instead you
must make your own reservations by contacting the hotel itself.  As this is
the high season for tourists in Santa Barbara, you should make sure and
reserve your accommodations quickly by contacting:

=46ess Parker's Doubletree Resort
(RESERVATION REQUEST ORDER FORM LOCATED BELOW)

NOTE:  IN ORDER TO GET THE AVAILABLE ROOMS, YOU MUST CONFIRM
HOTEL REGISTRATIONS BY JUNE 24, 1997.

When making reservations by phone, make sure and indicate that you are
registering for the Computational Neuroscience (CNS*98) meeting.   Students
will be asked to verify their status on check in with a student ID or other
documentation.

	Regular:  $ 250


BANQUET:  Registration for the meeting includes a single ticket to the
annual CNS Banquet.  Additional Banquet tickets can be purchased for $35
each person.  The banquet will be held on Thursday, July 30th.

DAY CARE:  Day care will be available at the conference for those who
inform us in advance of their day care needs. Note that day care will not
be provided during the evening.  Please send e-mail to
judy@bbb.caltech.edu.  Please provide the following information:

	1. name of parent(s),
	2. e-mail address,
	3. age of children and
	4. estimated times during which children will need day care.

Day care will be provided free of charge accept for children under the
age of 2 years old for whom a fee may be charged.

AIRFARE: Santa Barbara has its own small airport with daily flights from
Los Angeles and San Francisco.   In addition, ground transportation is
available to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles International Airport (and a
one  and a half hour drive).  Special discount rates have been arranged
with United and Northwest airlines, if you mention the following group ID
with airline reservations:

Northwest Airlines - Phone No:  1-800-328-1111 Meeting I.D. No:  NMG66
