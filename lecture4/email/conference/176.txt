January 6 - 8, 1999                                New York University

This message contains the program and registration form for CF99.
Please note that the deadline for early registration is December 1.

The sixth international conference Computational Finance 99 will be held
at NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. CF99 is sponsored by the
New York University Salomon Center, the Center for Research on Informa-
tion Systems and the Department of Statistics and Operations Research.

Computational Finance has emerged as a genuinely cross-disciplinary
research meeting. CF99 is the sixth in a series of conferences that have
been sponsored by the California Institute of Technology and the London
Business School. In the past, this conference was called Neural Networks
in the Capital Markets (NNCM). The expanding set of computational tools
has moved this meeting from its original emphasis on neural network
techniques to a broad spectrum of different methodologies.

With several hundred attendees, this fully refereed conference has
become an international forum where original research in advanced
computational applications in finance is presented and discussed.  
CF99 brings together decision makers and strategists from the
financial industries, with academics from finance, statistics,
economics, information systems and other disciplines.

>> The website of the conference is http://www.stern.nyu.edu/CF99 <<

The site should contain all the information you need to know about the
conference.  The rest of this e-mail includes for your convenience the
program and the registration form. For questions, please see the FAQ
part at the website.

Please register by December 1st, 1998, to avoid late charges.
