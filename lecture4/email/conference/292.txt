Call for Papers

Workshop on New Paradigms in Information Visualization and Manipulation

November 5-6, 1999
Kansas City, Missouri

In Conjunction with the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge
Management (CIKM'99)

http://www.cs.umbc.edu/conferences/cikm/npiv/npiv99cfp.html

The CIKM'99 Workshop on New Paradigms in Information Visualization and
Manipulation will be a forum for presentation and discussion of new ideas
and techniques for accessing, visualizing and manipulating information.
Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

   * visualization of multidimensional information spaces;
   * visualization of large, dynamic information collections;
   * shared virtual environments and simulations;
   * dynamic data visualization;
   * applications of virtual reality, including VRML;
   * multi-modal information displays;
   * applications of Internet tools such as MUDs, MOOs, and IRCs;
   * document and corpus metrics;
   * visual data mining and knowledge discovery;
   * Web or network-based visualization;
   * applications in document analysis;
   * software and hardware architectures to support information
     visualization;
   * and social interaction in multi-user information visualization systems.

We are particularly interested in reports of work in progress,
implementation techniques, and practical experience with visualization of
information collections of all sizes. A significant portion of the workshop
agenda will be devoted to discussion of pending research questions, and
directions for future work in this area.

Prospective participants are invited (but not required) to submit position
papers. The suggested maximum length is four pages. The position papers will
be reviewed by the organizing committee, and accepted papers will appear in
the workshop proceedings. The accepted papers will be selected for informal
presentation at the workshop. Accepted papers that were submitted
electronically will be available via WWW by early November.

Final Proceedings will be published by ACM Press after the workshop. Watch
this space for further information about preparation of camera-ready copy
for accepted papers.

Mail papers in either ASCII or HTML to ebert@cs.umbc.edu by September 15,
1999. We prefer e-mail submissions, but authors who lack e-mail access may
send papers to Dr. David Ebert, Department of Computer Science and
Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore,
MD 21250 USA. Submissions should include the title, author(s), author's
affiliation, e-mail address, fax number and postal address. In case of
multiple authors, please indicate which author is responsible for
correspondence.
