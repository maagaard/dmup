Solictation for submissions from the neural/evolutionary/fuzzy communities
to:




        Sixteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence

  Sponsored by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

                  July 18-22, 1999, Orlando, Florida


We would like to encourage the submission of high quality papers in the areas of
neural/fuzzy/evolutionary computation to AAAI'99. The 1999 AAAI conference
includes many program committee members in the neural/evolutionary/fuzzy areas.

This year AAAI'99 expressly solicits top-quality submissions in the
above-mentioned areas.  Every consideration will be given to provide a
fair review (albeit rigorous, in accordance with AAAI's long-standing high
standard) to each paper.  Your submission will be reviewed by
experts in your area who understand and appreciate its contribution
(or the lack of it) to the study of computational intelligence.

To highlight and showcase the advance and contributions that
neural/evolutionary/fuzzy communities are making in computational
intelligence, in a broader context that goes beyond disciplinary and
paradigmatic confines, we encourage you to submit your best work to
this year's AAAI and share that work with others in the broader arena
of artificial intelligence.
