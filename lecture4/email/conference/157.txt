Brown University's Departments of Applied Mathematics, Cognitive and
Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science have just received a new
NSF-supported Interdisciplinary Graduate Education, Research and training
(IGERT) program, with support for Graduate Students.  Could  you please
post the following message on your list.  Thank you.

A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE TRAINING PROGRAM

			    in

LEARNING AND ACTION IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY:
COGNITIVE, COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES

Deadline for Applications:  January 1, 1999

Brown University is actively recruiting graduate students for a new
NSF-supported
Interdisciplinary Graduate Education, Research and Training (IGERT)
program in "Learning and Action in the Face of Uncertainty:
Cognitive, Computational and Statistical Approaches".

The use of probabilistic models and statistical methods has
had a major impact on our understanding of language, vision, action, and
reasoning.  This training program provides students with the opportunity to
integrate a detailed study of human or artificial systems for language
acquisition and use, visual processing, action, and reasoning with
appropriate mathematical and computational models.  Students will be enrolled
in one of the three participating departments (Applied Mathematics,
Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science) and will
study an interdisciplinary program of courses in topics such as
statistical estimation, cognitive processes, linguistics, and
computational models.  The aim of this program is to provide promising
students with a mix of mathematical, computational and experimental
expertise to carry out multidisciplinary collaborative research across
the disciplines of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and
Cognitive Science.

Interested students should apply to the participating department
closest to their area of interest and expertise, and should indicate
their interest in the IGERT training program in their application.
Brown University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
