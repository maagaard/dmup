Call for Papers and Announcement

Mathematical Methods in Biomedical Imaging

Part of SPIE's International Symposium on
Optical Science and Technology

30July through 4August 2000
San Diego Convention Center and Marriott Hotel & Marina
San Diego California USA

The theme of this conference is the development, implementation,
and use of mathematical methods for biomedical imaging. The goal
is to provide a forum for scientific interaction between
researchers and practitioners in academics, industry, and
government.

Sessions may include, but are not limited to the following
aspects of biomedical imaging.

*statistical methods for developing, evaluating and comparing
 algorithms
*mathematical foundations
*innovative methods for image acquisition and restoration
*hardware implementations
*image compression techniques for medical or biomedical images
*mathematical methods of image enhancement and segmentation
*thin-plate spline techniques
*model building and expert systems
*limitations of existing or novel methods
*innovative applications to solve real biomedical and medical
 problems
*physiologically motivated information processing
*image reconstruction algorithms
*image registration


Abstract due date   3 January 2000
Manuscript due date 3 July 2000
