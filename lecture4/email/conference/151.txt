JULY 10-16, 1999

The premier conference on neural networks returns to Washington, D.C. in 
1999. Come celebrate the end of the Decade of the Brain and prepare to 
welcome the next millenium with a review of where we are and a preview of 
where we are going. IJCNN'99 spans the neural network field from neurons to 
consciousness, from learning algorithms to robotics, from chaos to control. 
This is an unparalleled opportunity to learn about cutting edge 
developments, to publicize your contributions, and to form new ties with 
your colleagues in industry, academia, and government from around the 
world. For details see our web site: www.inns.org or contact David Brown, 
IJCNN'99 General Chair: dgb@cdrh.fda.gov

CONFERENCE HIGHLIGHTS:
* Distinguished plenaries, highlighted by keynote speaker John Hopfield. 
* Strong technical program, presenting leading research in all 
  neural-network related fields.
* Focused special sessions on such subjects as Biomedical Applications and
  Chaos.
* Theme symposium: Modeling the Brain from Molecules to Mind.
* Forum on Global Competitiveness, including Congressional face-off on U.S.
  SBIR program.
* International workshops on "Getting Your Application to Market,"
  including patent and venture capital questions, and on "Getting Funding  
  for your Rsearch."
* Vigorous tutorial program, with courses taught by the leading experts in
  our field.
* Exhibits and demonstrations of real-world applications.
* Media fair-Show what you have achieved and help educate the public. 
* Awards for best posters and for student contributions.
