                       SPECIAL SESSION ON 

        3D IMAGING AND VIRTUAL INSPECTION OF OBJECTS AND PLACES 

         in EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO98)

           ISLAND OF RHODES, GREECE, 8-11 September 1998

Topic

The generation of 3D images of real world objects and environments
from images, range data  and video taken  from single/multiple cameras
is a fast-growing interdisciplinary field, with computer vision, 
photogrammetry, signal processing, computer graphics as 
the main contributing disciplines. The areas of application include
telepresence, interactive visit of historical and turistic sites and
museums, inspection of industrial parts, medical training,
electronic publishing. 
The special session intend to attract papers on both 3D imaging and 
visualization, notably on:
-3D aquisition techniques
-3D view registration 
-Fusion of range and intensity data 
-3D textured models compression
-VRML and model based rendering for PC
-Image based rendering
