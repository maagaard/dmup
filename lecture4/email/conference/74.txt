Boston, Massachusetts 
http://cns-web.bu.edu/cns-meeting/ 


Sponsored by Boston University's
Center for Adaptive Systems
and 
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
with financial support from DARPA and ONR 


How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence? 

The conference will include 125 invited lectures and contributed
lectures and posters by experts from 25 countries on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a
changing world. The conference is aimed at researchers and students of
computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science,
artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial
intelligence.

A single oral or poster session enables all presented work to be
highly visible.

Costs are kept at a minimum without compromising the quality of
meeting handouts and social events.

Although Memorial Day falls on Saturday, May 30, it is observed on
Monday, May 25, 1998.

Over 200 people attended last year's meeting, so early registration is
recommended. To register, please fill out the registration form
below. Student registrations must be accompanied by a letter of
verification from a department chairperson or faculty/research
advisor. If paying by check, mail to the address on the form. If
