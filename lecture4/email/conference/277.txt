The Fourth Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining (PAKDD-2000) will provide an international forum for the sharing
of original research results and practical development experiences
among researchers and application developers from different KDD
related areas such as machine learning, databases, statistics,
knowledge acquisition, data visualization, knowledge-based systems,
soft computing, and high performance computing. It will follow the
success of PAKDD-97 held in Singapore in 1997, PAKDD-98 held in
Australia in 1998, and PAKDD-99 held in China in 1999 by bringing
together participants from universities, industry and government.

	* Security and Privacy Issues 
	* Successful/Innovative KDD Applications in Science, Engineering,
          Medicine, Business, Education, Government, and Industry 


Both research and applications papers are solicited. All submitted
papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance
to KDD, originality, significance, and clarity. Accepted papers are
expected to be published in the conference proceedings by
Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence
series. A selected number of PAKDD-2000 accepted papers will be expanded
and revised for inclusion in major Japanese and/or international
journals.  Candidates include "Knowledge and Information Systems: An
International Journal" by Springer-Verlag
(http://kais.mines.edu/‾kais/). PAKDD Best Paper Award will be
conferred on the authors of the best paper at the conference. The
winner will be honored US$500 and free registration.

Authors are invited to email postscript files of their papers to
terano@gssm.otsuka.tsukuba.ac.jp or to send Four copies of them to

     Prof. Takao Terano (PAKDD-2000)
     Graduate School of Systems Management, 
     The University of Tsukuba, Tokyo
     3-29-1 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112, Japan
     Tel.: +81-3-3942-6855  
     Fax.: +81-3-3942-6829
     Email: terano@gssm.otsuka.tsukuba.ac.jp

Electronic submission is highly preferred. Papers must be received by
October 10, 1999.  Notification of acceptance will be emailed to the
first (or designated) author by December 15, 1999. Camera-ready copy of
accepted papers will be due January 15, 2000.

Format: The paper should consist of a cover page with title, authors'
names, postal and e-mail addresses, an approximately 200 word summary,
up to 5 keywords and a body not longer than ten pages with a single
space. It is recommended that the authors use the style file of
Springer-Verlag (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) to
minimize the possible conflict of paper length when preparing the
camera ready.
