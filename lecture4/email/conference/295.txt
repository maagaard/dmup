The following workshop is open to everyone. Your input to the discussion
is needed!

Since the workshop will take place during ICANN'99 at the conference
venue, it will be of particular interest to conference participants.


=============================================================           
                The Future and Prospects of 
                     Neural Networks

=============================================================
                       a workshop

                  Edinburgh University
            Appleton Tower, Lecture Theatre 2
            Wednesday, Sep. 8, 1999, 6-8 p.m.




Purpose


The purpose of the workshop is to consolidate views and discuss
perspectives of where the field of neural networks will be heading in
the near and medium-term future. The ultimate goal of NEuroNet - the
organiser of this workshop - is to compile a so-called "technological
roadmap" of neural networks and related methodologies, that presents a
visionary overview of the current trends in neural networks, as well as
likely future developments, foci and prospects of both basic and applied
research. For this, the opinions  from neural network researchers are
solicited.


Format

A number of panellists will present their short position papers about
the future of neural networks. This will be followed by an open
discussion, where everybody is invited to contribute their own view
about the prospects of the field.

Refreshments will be served to enable a continuation of the discussion
over a glass of wine.


Panellists:

       Georg Dorffner, OFAI Vienna 
       Geoffrey Hinton, Univ. College London 
       Erkki Oja, Helsinki Univ. of Technology 
       Nic Schraudolph, IDSIA Lugano 
       John Taylor, King's College London 
       David Willshaw, Edinburgh Univ. 

       Moderation: Mark Plumbley, NEuroNet


The organizer

This workshop is organised by NEuroNet - the network of excellence on
neural networks, sponsored by the EU commission
(http://www.kcl.ac.uk/neuronet).
