Announcing THE NEURON SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT
             An intensive hands-on course

Date: Saturday, August 1, through Wednesday, August 5, 1998

Place: San Diego Supercomputer Center

Course faculty includes:  Ted Carnevale
                          Michael Hines
                          Bill Lytton
                          Terry Sejnowski

This course is designed for experimentalists who wish to 
incorporate empirically-based modeling into their research plans.
It will be of interest to three broad classes of participants.
  1. Those who have little or no modeling experience will 
     learn not only the technical aspects of modeling 
     but also its philosophical basis and scientific rationale. 
  2. Intermediate users will learn how best to approach 
     common tasks, and under what circumstances special 
     components of NEURON's rich feature set might be 
     particularly helpful. 
  3. Experienced users will benefit from an update on new 
     features and a review of important topics that may have 
     escaped their attention when they first learned how to 
     use NEURON. 

Partial listing of the topics that will be covered:
  Design and construction of models of biophysical mechanisms,
     individual neurons, and networks of neurons 
  Strategies for efficient design and project management
  Adding new biophysical mechanisms 
  Optimization
  NEURON's new variable order, variable timestep method 
  Powerful features of the Vector and Impedance classes
  The graphical user interface for simulation control 
     and data analysis

Registration is limited to 20 individuals on a first-come, 
first-serve basis.  The registration fee is $525, which 
covers expenses that include room and board.  

Deadline for registration is Wednesday, July 1, 1998.
