                          WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

           UNDERSTANDING  THE  BRAIN  AND  ENGINEERING  MODELS

                    University of Sydney, Australia
                      January 18th and 19th, 1999


OUTLINE
=======
Over the last decade, research activities in the domain of neuromorphic
engineering and brain function modelling have significantly increased.
This workshop seeks to bring together a diverse group of researchers
to critically examine the progress made so far in this challenging research
area. We intend to address the following issues:

1. Sensorimotor integration in a broad sense and, more particularly,
2. Computational models of brain centres such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia
   and the superior colliculus,
3. Computational models of the visual and auditory pathways,
4. Microelectronic and other real-time implementations of such models
   and their incorporation in roving systems.
