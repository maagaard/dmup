Call for Participation:

2nd European Workshop on Neuromorphic Systems (EWNS2)

3-5 September 1999, Cottrell Building, University of Stirling,
Stirling, Scotland

Neuromorphic systems are implementations in silicon of sensory and
neural systems whose architecture and design are based on
neurobiology.  The area is at the intersection of many disciplines:
neurophysiology, computer science and electrical engineering.

Registration Forms and Further Information are available from the
WWW page
