THE FIFTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ARTIFICIAL LIFE AND ROBOTICS (AROB 5th '00)
For Human Welfare and Artificial Life Robotics
Jan.26-Jan.28, 2000, Compal Hall, Oita, JAPAN

OBJECTIVE

    is to start collaborative research on development of the theories
    of artificial life and complexity and their applications for robotics by
    making several research groups where the members are experts in their
    fields.  The research on artificial life and complexity were begun recently
    in Japan and are expected to be applied in various fields.  Especially
    the research groups will focus their attention on the development of the
    hardware of artificial brains using neurocomputers etc.  Also, the research
    groups will develop fundamental research on applications of artificial
    life and complexity for robotics by close relationships between researchers.

HISTORY 

    This symposium was founded in 1996 by the support of Science and
    International Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and
    Culture, Japanese Government.  This symposium was held in 1996 (First),
    1997 (Second), 1998 (Third), 1999 (Fourth) at B-Con Plaza, Beppu, Oita,
    Japan.  The Fifth symposium will be held in January 26-28, 2000 at Compal
    Hall, Oita, Japan.  This symposium invites you all to discuss development
    of new technologies concerning Artificial Life and Robotics based on
    simulation and hardware in twenty first century.
