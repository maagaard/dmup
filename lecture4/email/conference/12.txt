THE SYMPOSIUM

The 7th International Symposium on IC Technology, Systems and Applications, 
ISIC-97, will be held on 10-12 September 1997. Four tutorial sessions will 
be held in parallel on the first day.  This symposium will provide a forum 
for IC designers and manufacturing engineers, as well as academics to present 
and share new research and development results, techniques and problems. 
ISIC-97 coincides with the 50th anniversary of the invention of the 
TRANSISTOR. To celebrate this occasion, the symposium will be highlighted 
by the following keynote addresses :

1.   The Invention of the Transistor - The Foundation of the Silicon Age
       - Ian Ross, President Emeritus of Bell Laboratories

2.   Chips, Circuits and Systems in a Works-with World
       - Arno Penzias, Nobel Laureate, Vice President of Research,
