CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
IEEE Visualization 2000
October 8 - October 13, 2000
Doubletree Hotel
Salt Lake City, Utah

Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Visualization and Graphics 
In Cooperation with ACM/SIGGRAPH


Visualization is a vital research and applications frontier shared by
a variety of science, medical, engineering, business, and
entertainment fields. IEEE Visualization 2000 focuses on
interdisciplinary methods and collaboration among developers and users
of visualization methods across all of science, engineering, medicine,
and commerce. Sunday through Tuesday of Conference Week will include
tutorials, symposia, and mini-workshops. Papers, panels, case studies,
and works in progress will be presented Wednesday through Friday. We
invite you to participate in IEEE Visualization 2000 by submitting
your original research through papers, panels, case studies, work in
progress, and demonstrations. Share your perspectives through panels
and workshops, or your experience through tutorials. Please select the
forum appropriate to your submission, where it will be considered by
your peers for presentation. Particular focus on volume visualization
and information visualization are addressed in special two-day
symposia. For further information on the conference or symposia

Conference Papers (due March 31, 2000)
Papers are solicited that present research results related to all areas of
visualization. Original papers are limited to 5,000 words. The submission
of NTSC VHS video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper
is strongly recommended. This year we will begin accepting electronic
submissions of papers. If you choose to submit electronically, please
submit in the PDF or postscript format. If you chose to submit hardcopy,
please submit 7 hardcopies of all materials. Regardless of whether you
submit your paper electronically or in the hardcopy format, a complete
paper submission form including the abstract must be sent through the
conference website for each submission. Details for electronic submission
are available at http://www.erc.msstate.edu/conferences/vis2000/. 
Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings; the videos 
will be included in the conference video proceedings.

Hard copy paper submissions should be sent to:

 Vis2000, 
 Center for Scientific Computing and Imaging, 
 University of Utah,  
 50 S. Central Campus Dr.,Room 3440 MEB  
 Salt Lake City, UT 84112  
 +1 801-581-3154



Panel Proposals (due March 31, 2000)

Panels should address the most important issues in visualization
today.  Panelists should be experts in their fields who can discuss
the challenges of visualization, and engage the audience and fellow
panel members in a stimulating, interactive debate. Panel proposals
should describe the topic to be addressed and identify the prospective
panelists. Each panelist should include a position statement on the
topic and a short biography, the total of which should be limited to
500 words. The statements will be included in the conference
proceedings.
Panel proposals should be sent to Jamie Painter - jamie@acl.lanl.gov




Case Study Papers (due March 31, 2000)

Case studies are reports on how visualization has contributed to the
analysis of data in actual applications or studies of the
visualization process.  A short paper limited to 2500 words (maximum 4
pages B/W plus 1 page color) will be included in the conference
proceedings. Images and/or NTSC VHS video to accompany the paper are
recommended; the video will be included in the conference video
proceedings. This year we are encouraging electronic submissions.

For more detailed information concerning submission, see the web site,
or contact Robert van Liere - robertl@cwi.nl




Work in Progress (due June 15, 2000)

Submissions are solicited for Works In Progress sessions that pertain
to all areas of Visualization. These submissions must be original
abstracts, must describe work in progress by the authors and their
collaborators, and may not exceed 500 words or a maximum of 1
page. Images and/or NTSC VHS video to accompany the abstract are
recommended. Authors of accepted abstracts will have an opportunity to
submit a revised and extended abstract, as well as presenting the work
at the conference. These extended abstracts may not exceed 1000 words
or a maximum of 2 pages including images. All accepted abstracts will
be distributed at the conference but not published in the conference
proceedings. Videos associated with accepted abstracts may be included
in the conference video proceedings. All submissions will be done
electronically.  Submission details can be found at the conference web
site.
For further information, contact Sam Uselton - uselton1@llnl.gov

Mini-Workshop and Birds-of-a-Feather Proposals (due March 31, 2000)

Proposals may be submitted for Mini-Workshops and evening
Birds-Of-A-Feather (BOF) gatherings on visualization methods or
application areas. They should deal with state-of-the-art topics and

Demonstration Proposals

Visualization 2000 is a unique opportunity to present your products or
research to visualization experts from a wide variety of fields. We
invite demonstrations of commercial hardware, software, integrated
systems peripherals, and literature, as well as academic research. We
encourage demonstrators to have technical representatives in attendance.

For more information on participating in Visualization 2000
demonstrations, contact Eric Greenwade - leg@inel.gov




Creative Applications Lab

The Creative Applications Lab (CAL) is designed to let presenters
