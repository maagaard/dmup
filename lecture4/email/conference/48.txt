The Virtual Reality Education Foundation (Affectionately known as VeRGe)
and Curve, Inc. proudly present The VRML 98 DemoSIG Night.

The event will take place Wednesday, 18 February 1998 at the Doubletree
Hotel - Monterey, California.  Similar to last year's hit event, The VRML98
DemoSIG presents the highest quality VRML demos in a exciting, fast-paced
environment.  Lively and interesting, The VRML98 DemoSIG, will have even
more "interactive audience feedback devices" that many of you know and
love. These devices prove invaluable in keeping the event on schedule.

All submitted demos are judged for inclusion in the evening's program. Most
demos will be between 3-5 minutes long--depending on content of demo. 

DEADLINE for entering is Monday, 26 January 1998.  Demos judged later that
week.  The selected demo-ees will be contacted with detailed follow-up
information by Monday, 9 February 1998. 

While we will provide computers to use, we strongly suggest you run your
demo from a lap-top. 

We've learned tons from the last couple of events and have much more time
for set up.  This means more efficient demo setup and better advance
notification of winning demos.  We will also have much greater access to
the demo machines than at SIGGRAPH.

Sign up at http://www.verge.org/projects/vrml98/signup.html

Specific questions comments and/or feedback should be sent to the event's
Master of Ceremonies, Timothy Childs at timothy@curve.net

VRML '98 is Sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH and ACM SIGCOMM, in cooperation with
the VRML Consortium

Special thanks to the "coffee boss" for the t-ispiration.
