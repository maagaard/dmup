		Error Decomposition and Model Complexity

			     Huaiyu Zhu

  Bayesian information geometry provides a general error decomposition
  theorem for arbitrary statistical models and a family of information
  deviations that include Kullback-Leibler information as a special case.
  When applied to Gaussian measures it takes the classical Hilbert space
  (Sobolev space) theories for estimation (regression, filtering,
  approximation, smoothing) as a special case.  When the statistical and
  computational models are properly distinguished, the dilemmas of
  over-fitting and ``curse of dimensionality'' disappears, and the optimal
  model order disregarding computing cost is always infinity.

  will do doubt be interested in the long history of the relationship 
  between reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (rkhs), gaussian measures  
  and regularization,  -

      of the reproducing kernel are well known to have certain 
      optimal properties under restricted circumstances, 
      see e.g. Ch 12 of Spline Models and references there, but 
      if there are n observations, then the Bayes estimates 
      are found in an at most  n-dimensional subspace of the rkhs 
      associated with the prior, KW 1971.   B. Silverman 1982

      will also be of interest - convergence rates are related
      to the rate of decay of the eigenvalues of the reproducing
      kernel.
