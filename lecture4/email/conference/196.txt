Subject: Emergence and Development of Embodied Cognition: - Symposium Announcement
Reply-to: berthouz@etl.go.jp
Status: RO
X-Status: 


First International Symposium on Emergence and Development of Embodied Cognition
				(EDEC99)
February 9, 1999. At AIST Tsukuba Research Center, Auditorium.
Sponsored by Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL), AIST, MITI 
 and COE program by STA, Japan.

Co-organized by: Dr. Yasuo Kuniyoshi (ETL) and Prof. Rolf Pfeifer (Univ. Zurich)

Language: English.
Participation: Open to public, limited capacity (140seats).

Pre-registration strongly recommended (see our web page).

Content: This is a one-day open symposium consisting of invited talks by 
world leading researchers converging onto the issue of interaction dynamics 
of embodied cognition from the fields of complex systems, biology, 
neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, autonomous agents and robotics.
The symposium intends to provide an overview and to demonstrate the 
importance of interdisciplinary collaborative efforts into this common 
research issue.
