Dear Computational Neuroscientist,

This mailing is to bring to your attention the International
Conference on Theory and Mathematics in Biology and Medicine
1999, that will be held from Tuesday June 29 through Saturday
July 3, 1999, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

At this joint meeting of the European Society for Mathematical
and Theoretical Biology (ESMTB), the Society for Mathematical
Biology (SMB), and the Netherlands Society for Theoretical
Biology (NVTB), a full day is dedicated to Computational
Neuroscience. 

This day will comprise two plenary invited lectures, given by
Prof David Willshaw (University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom) and
by Prof Idan Segev (Hebrew University, Israel), 12 contributing
lectures of 20 minutes duration, as well as a poster session.

Please find all information of the conference at
http://www.bio.vu.nl/tmbm99/

We hope that the opportunity to emphasize Computational
Neuroscience in the broad field of Mathematical and Theoretical
Biology as well as the opportunity to become informed about the
progress in other interesting topics at this meeting will
encourage you to participate and submit an abstract. 

*******************************************************
 The deadline of Abstract Submission is 1st March, 1999.

Kind regards, and we look forward to meeting you this summer in
Amsterdam,

Brief overview of the Computational Neuroscience Session and
the rest of the conference:
----------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding the brain in health and disease is perhaps the
greatest challenge for science in the next century. Because the
brain is an extremely complex and organised system from the
molecular up to the behavioural level, this goal can not be
achieved without modelling and computational approaches. The
Computational Neuroscience Session aims at emphasizing this role
of Mathematical Modeling and Computer Simulation in Neuroscience.
Participants are invited to present progress in understanding the
structure, function and development the brain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The full-day major topics of this conference include 
1. Non-Linear Population Dynamics
2. Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases
3. Sequencing, Folding and Molecular Structure
4. Evolution, Game Theory and Adaptive Dynami
5. Computational Neuroscience
6. Immunology and Within-Host Dynamics of Pathogens

The half-day minor topics of this conference include 
1. Individual-Based Population Dynamics
2. Gene Networks
3. Pattern Formation and Morphogenesis
4. Education in Mathematical Biology
5. Parasites and Diseases in Wildlife
6. Metabolic Control Networks
7. Whole Heart Modelling
8. Metapopulation Dynamics
9. Toxicology
10. Particle Based Modelling
11. Networks, Cellular Signalling and Biological Rhythms
12. Classification Methodology
13. Miscellaneous
