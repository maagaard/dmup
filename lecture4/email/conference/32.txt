In the last few years, there have been an increasing interest
in the design of virtual worlds, using image synthesis, modeling,
multimedia and virtual reality. In practice this approach is something
broader and more fundamental. We can imagine virtual worlds reflecting
some parts of our reality, but also the synthesis of new universes
with new =93physical=94 laws and artificial life forms.
This interdisciplinary conference aims to provoke new understandings
of the important role that such  virtual worlds will play in domains
such as business, computer games, education, training, simulation, etc.
It will investigate the relationships between the natural and the
artificial
from both theoretical and philosophical points of views. It will also
address technical developments and practical applications.
VW=9298 hopes to extend the scientifical community by encouraging
contributions
from people involved in technical,  philosophical and art works related
to
the design and applications of virtual worlds. The meeting will involve
oral presentations, both invited and contributed, poster sessions,
tutorials, debates, exhibitions and demonstrations.

Authors are invited to present original work in one of the following
topics=20
(but not limited to) :

Artificial and Virtual Worlds, Applications of Virtual Worlds,
Synthesis of Virtual Worlds, Artificial Realities, MetaWorlds,
CyberSpace, Online Communities, Artificial Life,  Evolutionary
Computation, Simulation of Ecological and Evolving Environments,
Agents and Multi-Agents, Collective Behaviours, Emergence of
Social Behaviours, Multimedia, Virtual Realities, Image Synthesis,
Semiotic Issues, Philosophical Issues, Ethical problems ...

Important Dates :

Submission deadline : 28th February 1998.
Notification of acceptance : April 98.
Camera-ready due : May 1998.
Conference : July 1-3, 1998.
