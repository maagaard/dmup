                            Announcing IDA-99

       Third International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis
  Center for Mathematics and Computer Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands
                           9th-11th August 1999

Call for papers
===============
  IDA-99 will take  place in Amsterdam from 9th to 11th August 1999,  and is 
organised by Leiden University  in cooperation  with AAAI and NVKI.  It will
consist of  a stimulating  program  of tutorials,  invited talks  by leading
international  experts  in intelligent  data  analysis,  contributed papers,
poster sessions, and an exciting social program.
We plan to have  a special issue  of the  Intelligent Data Analysis  journal 
with extended versions of a number of papers presented during the symposium.

Objective
=========
  For many years the  intersection of computing and  data analysis contained
menu-based statistics  packages and not much else.  Recently,  statisticians
have embraced computing,  computer scientists are using statistical theories
and methods, and researchers in all corners are inventing algorithms to find
structure in vast  online datasets.  Data analysts  now have access to tools
for exploratory data  analysis,  decision tree induction,  causal induction,
function  finding,  constructing  customised  reference  distributions,  and
visualisation,  and there are intelligent assistants to advise on matters of
design and  analysis.  There are  tools  for  traditional,  relatively small
samples and also for enormous datasets.  In all,  the scope for probing data
in new and penetrating ways has never been so exciting.

  Our aim is for IDA-99 to bring  together  a wide  variety  of  researchers
concerned  with  extracting  knowledge  from  data,  including  people  from
statistics,  machine learning,  neural networks,  computer science,  pattern
recognition, database management, and other areas. The strategies adopted by
people from these areas are  often different,  and a synergy results if this
is recognised.  IDA-99  is intended  to stimulate interaction  between these
different areas, so that more powerful tools emerge for extracting knowledge
from  data  and  a  better  understanding  is  developed  of the  process of
intelligent data analysis.

It is the third symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis after  the successful
symposia Intelligent Data Analysis 97 (http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/ida97.html/)
and Intelligent Data Analysis 95.

Topics
======
Contributed papers are invited  on any  relevant topic,  including,  but not
restricted to:

APPLICATION & TOOLS:

   analysis of different kinds of data (e.g., censored, temporal etc)

     medicine, public policy, science)

   analysis of IDA algorithms
   classification, projection, regression, optimization, clustering
   data cleaning
   data pre-processing
   experiment design
   model specification, selection, estimation
   reasoning under uncertainty
   search
   statistical strategy
   uncertainty and noise in data

ALGORITHMS & TECHNIQUES:

   Bayesian inference and influence diagrams

Submissions
===========
  Participants  who  wish  to  present  a paper  are requested  to submit  a
manuscript,  not exceeding  10 single-spaced  pages.  We strongly  encourage
authors to format their manuscript using Springer-Verlag's Advice to Authors
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)   for   the  Preparation  of
Contributions to  LNCS Proceedings.  This submission format  is identical to
the one for the final camera-ready copy of accepted papers.  In addition, we
request a separate page detailing the paper title, authors names, postal and
email addresses, phone and fax numbers. Email submissions in Postscript form
are encouraged.  Otherwise,  five hard copies  of the manuscripts  should be
submitted.

Submissions should be sent to the IDA-99 Program Chair.

Important Dates
===============
February 1st, 1999              Deadline for submitting papers
April 15th, 1999                Notification of acceptance
May 15th, 1999                  Deadline for submission of final papers

Review
======
  All submissions will  be reviewed on the basis of relevance,  originality, 
significance, soundness and clarity.  At least two referees will review each
submission independently and final decisions will be made by program chairs,
in consultation with relevant reviewers.

Publications
============
  The proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series of Springer  (http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/).  The proceedings of
Intelligent Data Analysis 97 appeared in this series as LNCS 1280
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/volumes/1280.htm).

Location
========
  The symposium  will use  the facilities of the  Center for Mathematics and
Computer  Science  in  Amsterdam  (CWI -- http://www.cwi.nl/).  There  is an
auditorium  for more  than  200 participants  and  several  other rooms  for
parallel  sessions.    CWI  is  situated  on  the  Wetenschappelijk  Centrum
Watergraafsmeer (WCW) campus in the eastern part of Amsterdam.  Instructions
about how to get to CWI can be found at:
  http://www.cwi.nl/cwi/about/directions.html
On the campus there are  several other research institutes  and parts of the
University of Amsterdam (http://www.uva.nl/english).

Social Event
============
  For the social event we are thinking  about a boat trip through the canals
of Amsterdam,  with a  special dinner  in the  centre of  the city.  We will
provide each  participant  with a  ``social package'',  including a  list of
restaurants, bars, maps of town (http://www.channels.nl/themap.html), public
transport information, timetables of trains (http://www.ns.nl/), etc.
  There are  special  boats  and  trams  that  circle  along  the  touristic
attractions of Amsterdam and  hence it will be easy for the  participants to
find their way.  Further information can be found in the  The Internet Guide
to Amsterdam (http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/amsterdam.html),  panoramic pictures
are also available (http://www.cwi.nl/~behr/PanoramaUK/Panorama.html).

Exhibitions
===========
  IDA-99  welcomes demonstrations  of software  and publications  related to
intelligent data analysis.
