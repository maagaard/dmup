CALL FOR PAPERS

The recent increasing interest in the synergy between evolutionary
computation and neural networks provides an impetus for a symposium
dedicated to furthering our understanding of this synergy and the
potential utility of hybridizing evolutionary and neural techniques. 
The First IEEE Symposium on Combinations of Evolutionary Computation 
and Neural Networks will offer a forum that focuses specifically on 
the hybridization of evolutionary and neural computation. 
In particular, papers are solicited in the areas of

+ evolutionary training of neural networks, 
+ evolutionary design of network topologies, 
+ evolution of learning (weight updating) rules, 
+ evolving solutions to inverse neural network problems, 
+ the performance of alternative variation operators in designing 
  neural networks, 
+ comparisons between evolutionary and other training methods, 
+ evolving developmental rules for neural network design, and 
+ the use of coevolution in optimizing neural networks for pattern 
  recognition, gaming, or other applications. 

Other topics that combine evolutionary and neural computation are also
welcome. Submitted papers should represent unpublished, original work.
