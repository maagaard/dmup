CALL FOR PAPERS


Ninth Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting

CNS*2000

July 16-20, 2000

Brugge, Belgium


http://cns.numedeon.com/cns2000


DEADLINE FOR SUMMARIES AND ABSTRACTS:


**>> 11:59 pm  January 26, 2000 <<<<**



This is the ninth annual meeting of an interdisciplinary conference
addressing a broad range of research approaches and issues involved in
the field of computational neuroscience.  These meetings bring together
experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers,
computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and
mathematicians interested in the functioning of biological nervous
systems.


THIS YEAR'S MEETING


The meeting in 2000 will take place for the first time in Europe, in
Brugge, Belgium from the 16th to the 20th of July.  The meeting will
officially start at 9 am, Sunday, July 16th and end with the annual
banquet on Thursday evening, July 20th.  There will be no parallel
sessions.  The meeting will include time for informal workshops
organized both before and during the meeting.


The meeting will be held at the Congress Centre Old Saint-John in
Brugge (http://www.brugge.be/toerisme/en/meetinge.htm).  Brugge is
known in some circles as "The Venice of the North" and is an old and
beautiful city with a modern conference center and easy access to
international travel connections.  Housing accommodations will be
available in numerous nearby hotels.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS


With this announcement we solicit paper submissions to the meeting.
Papers can include experimental, model-based, as well as more abstract
theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological computation.
We especially encourage papers that mix experimental and theoretical
studies.  We also accept papers that describe new technical approaches
to theoretical and experimental issues in computational neuroscience.



Papers for the meeting should be submitted electronically using a
custom designed JAVA/HTML interface found at the meeting web site:
http://cns.numedeon.com/cns2000.  Authors must submit two descriptions
of completed work.  First, a 100 word abstract must be provided that
succinctly describes the research results.  This abstract is published
in the conference program as well as on the meeting web site.  Authors
must also submit a 1000 word description of their research.  This
description is in the review process and should clearly state the
objectives and context for the work as well as the results and its
significance.  Information on all authors must be entered. Submissions
will not be considered if they lack any of the required information or
if they arrive late.


All submissions will be acknowledged immediately by email.  It is
important to note that this notice, as well as all other communication
related to the paper will be sent to the designated correspondence
author only.  Full instructions for submission can be found at the
meeting web site:   http://cns.numedeon.com/cns2000.


THE REVIEW PROCESS


All papers submitted to CNS are peer reviewed.  Because the meeting
this year will be held in Europe, we have accelerated the process of
paper acceptance to allow more time to make travel plans.  For this
reason, the review process will take place in two rounds.  In the first
papers will be judged and accepted for the meeting based on the clarity
with which the work is described and the biological relevance of the
research.  For this reason authors should be careful to make the
connection to biology clear in both the 100 word abstract and the 1000
word research summary.  We expect to notify authors of meeting
acceptance by the second week of February.


The second stage of review will take place in March and involves
evaluation of each submission by two referees.  The primary objective
of this round of review will be to select papers for oral presentation.
 All accepted papers not selected for oral talks as well as papers
explicitly submitted as poster presentations will be included in one of
three evening poster sessions.  Authors will be notified of the
presentation format of their papers no later than the second week of
May, 2000.


CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS


All research accepted and presented at the CNS meeting is eligible for
publication in the CNS proceedings.  The proceedings volume is
published each year as a special supplement to the journal
'Neurocomputing'.  In addition the proceedings are published in a hard
bound edition by Elsevier Press.  6 page proceedings papers are
submitted in October following the meeting.  For reference, papers
presented at CNS*98 can be found in volumes 26 and 27 of Neurocomputing
published in 1999.


STUDENT TRAVEL GRANTS


We have made an extra effort this year to raise funds to provide travel
grant supplements for students and postdoctoral fellows presenting
papers.  Also, we will have travels grants available both for Europeans
and USA participants. While grants are awarded based on need, we
anticipate that any presenting student requiring a travel supplement
will be able to receive some assistance.  In addition, the program
committee has arranged very inexpensive housing for students in
Brugge.
