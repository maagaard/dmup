For those of you who maintain WWW pages including lists of related ANN
sites: we would appreciate if you could add the above URL to your list;
thank you very much!

We try as much as possible to avoid multiple sendings of this call for
papers; however please apologize if you receive this e-mail twice, despite
our precautions.

For 7 years the ESANN conference has become a major event in the field of
neural computation.  ESANN is a human-size conference focusing on
fundamental aspects of artificial neural networks (theory, models,
algorithms, links with statistics, data analysis, biological
background,...).

The programme of the conference can be found at the URL
http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esann, together with practical information about
the conference venue, registration,...  Other information can be obtained by
sending an e-mail to esann@dice.ucl.ac.be .
