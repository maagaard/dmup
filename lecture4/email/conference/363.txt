                               NNW 2000
               10th Anniversary International Conference on
             Artificial Neural Networks and Intelligent Systems
                 Prague, Czech Republic, July 9-12, 2000


Purpose of the conference

The main focus of NNW2000 is the development and application of
computational paradigms inspired by natural processes, namely
artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and related
subjects including adaptive agents, artificial life, soft computing,
etc.

The conference takes place in the year of the 10th anniversary of
founding the Neural Network World international scientific journal. It
is jointly organized by Institute of Computer Science, Academy of
Sciences of the Czech Republic, Neural Network World Editorial Board
and Action M Agency.
