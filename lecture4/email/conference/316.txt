INTRODUCTION

The science of neural computation focusses on mathematical aspects to
solve complex practical problems, and it also seeks to help neurology,
brain theory and cognitive psychology in the understanding of the
functioning of the nervous system by means of computational models of
neurons, neural nets and subcellular processes. NC'2000 aims to become a
major point of contact for research scientists, engineers and
practitioners throughout the world in the field of Neural Computation.
Participants will share the latest research, developments and ideas in
the wide arena of disciplines encompassed under the heading of NC'2000
as a follow-up of the most successful NC'98 conference in Vienna,
Austria.

THE FASCINATING CITY OF BERLIN

The old and new capital of Germany is a mecca for scientists and
cultural enthusiasts, for day workers and night owls. Charming with its
several opera houses, concert halls, cabarets, and beer gardens, Berlin
is full of spontaneous cultural events or happenings. As an urban
building site for the future, it is at the same time a living
contradiction and a casual place with relaxation areas and large parks
right in the city center. The fine nature, pine tree forests, and 1001
lakes around the city supply Berlin with it s very specific sparkling
air in spring time. No other city in Germany has during the last 100
years played such a prominent role in history and in the imagination of
the people Social and industrial revolution in the last century, world
war I and later manifestation of the first German republic, the 'Golden
Twenties', nazis dictatorship and world war II, splitting by the Berlin
Wall, 'economic miracle' in the west and socialistic showpiece city in
the east, '68 student and alternative lifestyle movement in the west and
peace movement in the east, and finally, the fall of the Wall. Berlin
tempts with its many research facilities, and it is Germany's largest
industrial city with headquarters or dependences of most major
companies. At present, approximately 3.5 million inhabitants live in the
reunified city, among which more than 120.000 students, who study in
three universities and twelve colleges or schools of arts. 
Berlin ist eine Reise wert. 
Welcome!
