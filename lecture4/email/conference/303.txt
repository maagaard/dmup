Dear Colleagues:

As program co-chair of 4th International Conference on COMPUTATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE (Atlantic City, February 27 - March 3,
2000), I am organizing a special session on FIELD COMPUTATION
(continuum-limit neural computation).  (The general conference Call for
Papers is attached.)  A number of groups are now working in this area,
and the time is ripe to gather in one place and compare results.

If you have been working in this area, I hope you will consider
submitting a paper to this session.  Although the conference CFP lists
Sep 1 as the deadline for receipt of summaries, we will continue to
receive them for this special session through Sep 30.  However, if you
are interested in participating but cannot meet this deadline, please
let me know and I'll see what we can arrange.

Best wishes and thank you,
Bruce MacLennan
