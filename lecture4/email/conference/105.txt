                  Emotions, Qualia and Consciousness
                       Ischia (Naples), Italy
                        October 19-24, 1998

      A course offered by the International School of Biocybernetics
 in collaboration with Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona

The experience of emotion is a ubiquitous component of the stream of
consciousness, and emotional "qualia" appear to interact with other
contents and processes of consciousness in complex ways.

Many scholars and scientists believe that no scientific or philosophic
account of consciousness can be complete without an understanding of the
role of emotion.

In an effort to advance such understanding, the International School of
Biocybernetics of the Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici, in
collaboration with Consciousness Studies of The University of Arizona,
has organized this workshop.

Abstracts of 350-500 words are being accepted that are either 
reports of empirical studies or focused theoretic contributions 
in any of the following topic areas. 

1) Emotion and neuroscience 
2) The role of emotion in conscious cognition 
3) Conscious awareness of emotion and health 
4) Research methods in emotion 
5) Emotion and development 
6) Philosophy of emotion 
7) Culture and emotion 

Abstracts should be clearly written and specific. 
Deadline for abstracts submission is July 1. 
Decision notification on acceptance will be by August 7. 

If at all possible, please submit abstracts to center@u.arizona.edu.
