Subject: Workshop on Self-Organising Systems
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Dear All,


Emergent Behaviour Computing - one of EPSRCs Emerging Computing
networks- is holding its first two-day workshop on "Self-Organising
Systems - Future Prospects for Computing" at 
                UMIST, Manchester, England
                on 28/29 October, 1999
The Workshop covers divers aspects of self-organising systems -
both natural and artificial, and aims to present the best of
international and UK activity.  The overall focus is the current and
future application of self-organisation as an alternate paradigm for
"intelligent" computation. The Workshop represents an important
opportunity for those active, or just interested, in self-organising
system research and application to hear about current work, discuss
future directions and priorities, and form research contacts.  There
are several leading overseas speakers, and contributions from the UK
community are invited.  Details of submission and registration can be
obtained from http://images.ee.umist.ac.uk/emergent.
