             EU ADVANCED COURSE IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
                                 FIRST CALL

                        AUGUST 23 - SEPTEMBER 17, 1999

         INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS, TRIESTE, ITALY                   

DIRECTORS:    Erik De Schutter (University of Antwerp, Belgium)
              Klaus Obermayer (Technical University Berlin, Germany)
              Idan Segev (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel)
              Alessandro Treves (SISSA, Trieste, Italy)


The EU Advanced Course in Computational Neuroscience introduces students 
to the panoply of problems and methods of computational neuroscience, 
simultaneously addressing several levels of neural organisation, from 
subcellular processes to operations of the entire brain.

The course consists of two complementary parts.  A distinguished 
international faculty gives morning lectures on topics in experimental 
and computational neuroscience.  The rest of the day is devoted to
practicals, including learning how to use simulation software and 
how to implement a model of the system the student wishes to study on 
individual unix workstations.  

The first week of the course introduces students to essential neuro-
biological concepts and to the most important techniques in modeling 
single cells, networks and neural systems.  Students learn how to apply 
software packages like GENESIS, MATLAB, NEURON, XPP, etc. to the solution 
of their problems.  During the following three weeks the lectures will 
cover specific brain functions.  Each week topics ranging from modeling 
single cells and subcellular processes through the simulation of simple 
circuits, large neuronal networks and system level models of the brain 
will be covered. The course ends with a presentation of the students' 
projects.

The EU Advanced Course in Computational Neuroscience is designed for 
advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in a variety of 
disciplines, including neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, 
computer science and psychology.  Students are expected to have a basic 
background in neurobiology as well as some computer experience.  

A total of 30 students will be accepted.  Students of any nationality 
can apply.  We specifically encourage applications from researchers who 
work in less-favoured regions of the EU and from women. Travel grants 
and free accomodations are available for students from most countries in 
the world.
