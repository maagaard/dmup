		ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

	Workshop on  Neural Networks and Connectionism

		Magdeburg, Germany, 29.Sep.1999, 


The meeting of the working group 1.1.2 "Connectionism" of the German
Society
of Computer Science (GI) takes place in Magdeburg during the
GI-Workshop-Days
Learning, Knowledge Discovery, and Adaptivity.  It is devoted to the
discussion of new trends and ongoing research projects in the areas of
connectionism and neural networks.

TOPICS
We want to discuss papers covering empirical, theoretical or
interdisciplinary topics from connectionsm and neural networks,
especially
         * Theory: Prediction and generalization, regularization,
           computational learning theory, support vector machines,
           approximation and estimation, learning in dynamical systems.
         * Algorithms andArchitectures:supervised and unsupervised
learning,
           model selection, feedforward aand recurrent architectures,
hybrid
           symbolic-subsymbolic approaches.
         * Knowledge discovery and Adaptivity: active learning,
reinforcement
           learning, Markovian state estimation, novelty detection,
           information content, time-varying systems.
         * Applications: mmedical diagnosis, data mining, expert
systems,
           financial predictions, time series analysis, information
retrieval,
           etc.

Deadline for contributions: July 31, 1999
