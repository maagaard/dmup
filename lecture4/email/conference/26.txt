  Workshop on New Paradigms in Information Visualization and Manipulation

			 November 13-14, 1997
			  Las Vegas, Nevada



In Conjunction with the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge
Management (CIKM'97)  

The CIKM'97 Workshop on New Paradigms in Information Visualization and
Manipulation will be a forum for presentation and discussion of new
ideas and techniques for accessing, visualizing and manipulating
information. Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

      applications of virtual reality, including VRML; 
      shared virtual environments and simulations; 
      dynamic data visualization; 
      visualization of multidimensional information spaces; 
      visualization of large, dynamic information collections; 
      applications of Internet tools such as MUDs, MOOs, and IRCs; 
      document and corpus metrics; 
      multi-modal information displays; 
      visual data mining and knowledge discovery; 
      Web or network-based visualization; 
      applications in document analysis 
      software and hardware architectures to support information visualization;
      and social interaction in multi-user information visualization systems. 

We are particularly interested in reports of work in progress,
implementation techniques, and practical experience with visualization
of information collections of all sizes. A significant portion of the
workshop agenda will be devoted to discussion of pending research
questions, and directions for future work in this area.

Prospective participants are invited (but not required) to submit
position papers. The suggested maximum length is four pages. The
position papers will be reviewed by the organizing committee, and
accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings. Some of the
accepted papers will be selected for informal presentation at the
workshop. Accepted papers that were submitted electronically will be
available via WWW by early November.

Final Proceedings will be published by ACM Press after the
workshop. See the Web page for further information about preparation
of camera-ready copy for accepted papers.

Mail papers in either ASCII or HTML to ebert@cs.umbc.edu by September
20, 1997. We prefer e-mail submissions, but authors who lack e-mail
access may send papers to Dr. David Ebert, Department of Computer
Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore
County, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA. Submissions should include the title,
author(s), author's affiliation, e-mail address, fax number and postal
address. In case of multiple authors, please indicate which author is
responsible for correspondence.
