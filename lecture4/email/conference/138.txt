Short course announcement

Title:  Using the NEURON Simulation Environment

What, where, and when:  This is a Satellite Symposium 
that will be presented at the Society for Neuroscience 
meeting in Los Angeles, CA, on Saturday, Nov. 7, 1998. 

Speakers:  N.T. Carnevale, M.L. Hines, 
           J.W. Moore, and G.M. Shepherd

Description

NEURON, which runs under UNIX/Linux, MSWindows, and MacOS, 
is an advanced simulation environment that handles realistic 
models of biophysical mechanisms, individual neurons, and 
networks of cells. In lectures with live computer 
demonstrations, this course will present information 
essential for teaching and research applications of NEURON. 
It will emphasize practical issues that are key to the most 
productive use of this powerful and convenient modeling tool. 

Partial list of topics to be covered: 
* How NEURON separates biologically important features, such as 
  spatio-temporal complexity, from purely numerical concerns 
  like accuracy and stability. 
* Efficient design, implementation, and use of models, including
  variable-order variable-timestep integration, and NEURON's 
  latest tools for network simulations. 
* Using the graphical interface to control and modify simulations, 
  and to analyze data and simulation results without additional
  programming. 
* Getting the most out of special features such as vectors and 
  the extensive function library. 
* Expanding NEURON's repertoire of biophysical mechanisms. 
* Using NEURON simulations in neuroscience education. 
* Databases for empirically-based modeling. 

Each registrant will receive a CD-ROM with software, plus a
comprehensive set of notes that includes material which has 
not yet appeared elsewhere in print. 

Registration is limited to 55 individuals on a first-come, 
first-serve basis. 

Early registration deadline Friday, October 2, 1998
Late registration deadline Friday, October 16, 1998 
NO on-site registration will be accepted.
