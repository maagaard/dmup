                     COGNITIVE AND NEURAL SYSTEMS:
                    A TENTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION

                         Tuesday, May 23,2000
                                at the
               Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
                           Boston University
                           677 Beacon Street
                           Boston, MA  02215

This one-day event celebrates the tenth anniversary of our department. It
will be filled with talks by past graduates of the department, and will
include plenty of time for discussion and celebration. The event is open to
the public and there is no admission fee. If you plan to attend, please send 
email to Carol Jefferson (caroly@cns.bu.edu) by May 1, 2000 so that we
can estimate attendance for purposes of planning enough food and drink.

The celebration will come right before the Fourth International Conference
on Cognitive and Neural Systems, which occurs from Wednesday, May 24
through Saturday, May 27. This conference drew around 300 participants 
from 31 countries last year, and focuses on the two themes:

How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence?
