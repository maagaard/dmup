Dear Colleague,

Here I would like to give you some information on the 
XVII meeting of the Swiss Society of Neuropathology, 
which will take place in St. Moritz (one of the most 
famous Swiss skiing resorts) in March 14-18th, 1998. 
This venue sports a 30-year-old tradition of bringing 
together neuropathologists, neuro-clinicians, and 
neuroscientists interested in disease mechanisms. 
We specifically welcome the participation of "Aerzte im 
Praktikum", medical students and PhD students, who will 
enjoy a  50% discount on the registration fee (details 
below). 

In order to foster intense communication in-house and on 
the skiing slopes, the meeting will be residential at the 
following address: 
  Hotel Laudinella 
  Address/Adresse: 7500 St. Moritz
  Telephone: ++41-81-832 21 31
  Telefax:   ++41-81-833 57 01 

Main topic will be "Growth and Death in the Nervous 
System". We will have sessions on experimental and 
clinical neurooncology, on the genetics of neural cancer, 
on neurodegeneration, on prion diseases, and on 
neuroinflammatory diseases.

following items:

2. How to register

The easiest way is to register on-line through our web 
site at address 
http://www.unizh.ch/pathol/neuropath/StMoritz98/neuro17a.html 

The web site mentioned above contains detailed 
information on the venue, on St. Moritz, and on the 
skiing conditions (including live camera pictures from 
the neighbouring mountains updated several times per 
day). 

In case you have any problems, or need clarifications, 
feel free to e-mail me to the following address: 
adriano@pathol.unizh.ch

Alternatively, (but somewhat less conveniently)you can fill 
the following fields of e-mail registration 
form found below here, and e-mail it back to us! 
This way you can be sure that there will be 
no transcription mistakes. 

Finally (but much less conveniently), you can print out the e-
mail registration form, and fax (or send) it to us at the 
following number: 
+41-1-255 4402

Registration will be confirmed by our office via regular 
mail, as soon as the due amount of fees (for 
registration, accommodation etc.) is remitted. 

METHODS OF PAYMENT:
- We strongly favor payment via credit card 
(Euro/Master/VISA). However, we should alert you of 
the (slight) possibility that some malicious hackers 
may intercept the e-mail and misuse your card 
information. We believe that this is even less likely 
than the chance of developing e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease after consumption of beef, but we cannot take 
responsibility for it. 
- Alternatively, you can send us a cheque. For 
Eurocheques there is no charge, but our bank charges 
SFr. 20 for all other bank cheques (which, we agree 
with you, is outrageous but inevitable), and which 
you need to add to the total fee. 
- Finally, you can remit a direct bank wire transfer to 
the following account: 1103-0021.713, Zurcher 
Kantonalbank, Filiale Limmatquai (Clearing No.703), 
CH-8025 Zurich (Keyword: NP/KONGRESS St. MORITZ)
- If you decide to send us a cheque or perform a wire 
transfer, we will be able to confirm registration only 
after receipt of proof of payment by regular mail.

Below is the registration form. If you decide to register 
by e-mail (rather than by using the web site registration 
at http://www.unizh.ch/pathol/neuropath/StMoritz98/neuro17a.html),  please 
fill every field by typing right after each semicolon. Do 
not change or delete any item to the left of the 
semicolons, lest our electronic processing system will 
not work properly.

IMPORTANT: If you are registering more than one person 
(e.g. an accompanying person, or a co-worker), please 
fill and e-mail one registration form for each individual 
person to be registered.

3. How to submit abstracts
IMPORTANT: Deadline for submission is November 30th, 
1997. 
- The language of the meeting is English. We will have 
both oral and poster sessions. Since we anticipate 
fierce competition for space in oral communications, 
oral format cannot be guaranteed in advance. If you 
submit an oral communication, you will be notified of 
acceptance before Dec. 31, 1997. In negative case, you 
will be given the option to present your work as a 
poster. At any rate, each participant can contribute 
only one oral communication (but an unlimited number 
of posters).
- Electronic submission of the abstract is imperative 
for acceptance and for inclusion in the abstract 
booklet. The preferred way to submit an abstract is to 
e-mail it as a fully formatted word processor file 
attachment to the following address: 
Adriano@pathol.unizh.ch 
- Alternatively (but less conveniently), you can submit 
a "text-only" (i.e. unformatted) abstract. You can 
include the text in the body of your e-mail, or submit 
through our web site 
http://www.unizh.ch/pathol/neuropath/StMoritz98/neuro17a.html
- Whenever possible, the length of each abstract should 
not exceed 500 words (but we will not be fiscal about 
this). You are highly welcome to include figures and 
drawings into your abstracts, as long as these can be 
incorporated into a MS-Word or RTF document. We can 
read almost all popular word processor formats for 
Windows and for Macintosh. MS Word for Windows, or 
"Rich Text Format" (RTF), give the least problems and 
are preferred. 
- Posters can be up to 150cm high, but may not be wider 
than 80cm.
- Oral communications are limited to 10 minutes + 2 
minutes discussion. Session chairmen and chairwomen 
are empowered to implement this time limit, if need 
be, with brachial force.  

CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT: In addition to the abstract proper, 
you are required to fill the fields of the following 
form:

  will reimbursement be less than 95%.
