SIGGRAPH 97 VRML DEMO SIG  
LA Convention Center in Los Angeles, CA (Room 151)
*Monday, August 4th*
6:00pm to 8:00pm

This event will be styled upon the successful VRML97 Demo Night and will be
co-hosted by LAVUG  (Los Angeles VRML Users Group) and The Virtual Reality
Education Foundation (affectionately known as VeRGe). Curve's Timothy
Childs will be the Monster of Ceremonies.

Since the world is waiting to see some "real applications" we strongly
encourage the submission of content and applications which answers the
question "VRML--what's it good for?"  Show us what you've got!

We are particularly interested in:

 ~ Business Applications
 ~ Art/Entertainment
 ~ Education
 ~ Scientific Visualization

..but innovative works outside the boundaries of these limited 
categories will be warmly received.

Selected demo-ees will have a MAXIMUM OF 5 MINUTES to wow the hard to
please audience (the room seats 630). Akin to the VRML 97 Demo Night, the
audience will be "armed" with a number of "interactive audience feedback
devices" to keep the event on schedule.

		********IMPORTANT********  
***DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS IS JULY 23, 1997***.

Demo slots are limited.  Submit your VRML Application NOW at:

     http://www.verge.org/projects/siggraph/signup.html

(Please make sure to double check your URLs and make sure they work before
submitting.)

Questions, feedback or suggestions?  Contact:

     Timothy Childs (VeRGe/Curve) at timothy@curve.net or 
     Carole Sumler (LAVSUG) at sumler@fastxchange.com

Good luck and see you there!
