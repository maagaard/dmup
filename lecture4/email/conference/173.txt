           Weightless Neural Networks Workshop WNNW-99
                   York, UK, 30th March 1999


 WNNW-99 is a third in a series of premier international meetings for
 dissemination and discussion of research trends and results in
 weightless neural networks. The main aim of these conferences is to
 pro- vide a convenient forum for discussion of recent results and
 ideas in all areas pertaining to weightless neural networks, RAM based
 networks and N-tuple networks including architectures, algorithms,
 coding, hardware implementations and novel applications.

 The workshop will be held at the Department of Computer Science,
 University of York, UK. Most participants will be staying at the
 on-campus accommodation, close to the venue. The meetings will start
 on Tuesday, 30th of March, 1999 and will last for two days.

 This meeting is supported by the Advanced Computer Architecture Group
 at the Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK.
