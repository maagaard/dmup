		SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT AND A CALL FOR PAPERS:


 		   The First International Workshop on

	=====================================================
	Cooperative Research Information Systems in Physics: 
		            CRISP97
	=====================================================

 	    Aug. 31 - Sept. 4, 1997, Oldenburg, Germany

	Sponsored and supported by:
		- The European Physical Society (EPS)
		- Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG)
		- Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Wissenschaft, 
                  Forschung und Technologie  (BMBF), Germany
		- Elsevier Science, The Netherlands

Scope of the workshop:
----------------------
	The purpose of the workshop is to bring together physicists, 
	computer scientists, and other experts to discuss issues 
	related to cooperative scientific information systems. 
	Internet and electronic communication methods have greatly 
	affected the way scienceis published and distributed, and 
	the importance of these issues will increase in the future. 
	It is therefore very important for the scientists, publishers, 
	and computer experts to meet and map their needs and discuss 
	the directions for the future development of electronic 
	communication in sciences.

	These issues are not limited to physics information systems,
	and one of the aims of this meeting is to bring together people 
	and ideas from other related fields such as chemistry, mathematics, 
	and computer sciences.	
		
Central Topics of CRISP '97 Include: 
-------------------------------------
	- Scientific documents
	- Educational systems, 
	- Administrative information treatment, etc.
	- Electronic publishing
	- Information Infrastructure in Physics (and sciences 
	  in general), cooperative work and distributed systems 
	- Technical issues: user friendly interfaces, metdata,
	  protocols, formats, methods, standards, etc.
	- Dedicated systems, expert systems, tools, etc.
