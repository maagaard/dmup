*****CALL FOR PAPERS***** 

THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE AND NEURAL SYSTEMS 
May 26-29, 1999 

Sponsored by Boston University's
Center for Adaptive Systems
and 
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
with financial support from DARPA and ONR 


How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence? 

The conference will include invited tutorials and lectures, and
contributed lectures and posters by experts on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt 
to a changing world. The conference is aimed at researchers and 
students of computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive 
science, artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, 
and artificial intelligence.

A single oral or poster session enables all presented work to be
highly visible.

Abstract submissions encourage submissions of the latest results. 

Costs are kept at a minimum without compromising the quality of
meeting handouts and social events.


CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

Session Topics:

* vision 		     * spatial mapping and navigation 
* object recognition 	     * neural circuit models

Contributed Abstracts must be received, in English, by January 29,
1999.  Notification of acceptance will be given by February 28,

only. Fax submissions will not be accepted. Abstract title, author
name(s), affiliation(s), mailing, and email address(es) should begin
each Abstract.  An accompanying cover letter should include: Full
title of Abstract; corresponding author and presenting author name,
address, telephone, fax, and email address; and a first and second
choice from among the topics above, including whether it is biological
(B) or technological (T) work.  Example: first choice: vision (T);
second choice: neural system models (B).  (Talks will be 15 minutes
long. Posters will be up for a full day. Overhead, slide, and VCR
facilities will be available for talks.) Abstracts which do not meet
these requirements or which are submitted with insufficient funds will
be returned. Accepted Abstracts will be printed in the conference
proceedings volume. No longer paper will be required. The original and
3 copies of each Abstract should be sent to: Cynthia Bradford, Boston
University, Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, 677 Beacon
Street, Boston, MA 02215.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Early registration is recommended.  To
register, please fill out the registration form below.  Student
registrations must be accompanied by a letter of verification from a
department chairperson or faculty/research advisor. If accompanied by
an Abstract or if paying by check, mail to the address above.  If
paying by credit card, mail as above, or fax to (617) 353-7755, or
email to cindy@cns.bu.edu. The registration fee will help to pay for a

STUDENT FELLOWSHIPS: Fellowships for PhD candidates and postdoctoral
fellows are available to cover meeting travel and living costs. The
deadline to apply for fellowship support is January 29, 1999. Applicants
will be notified by February 28, 1999. Each application should include 
the applicant's CV, including name; mailing address; email address; 
current student status; faculty or PhD research advisor's name, address, 
and email address; relevant courses and other educational data; and a 
list of research articles. A letter from the listed faculty or PhD advisor 
on official institutional stationery should accompany the application and 
summarize how the candidate may benefit from the meeting. Students who also 
submit an Abstract need to include the registration fee with their
Abstract. Reimbursement checks will be distributed after the meeting.
