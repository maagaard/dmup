The Third International Symposium on› Functional Neuroreceptor Mapping


NeuroreceptorMapping00
June 9 - 11, 2000
New York, NY› USA
›

In June 2000, a symposium with the theme of "Mapping Neuroreceptors at
Work" will be held at Columbia University in New York City USA. This
meeting will follow in the footsteps of the first two symposiums of this

type, which were held in Aarhus, Denmark in May of 1997 and Ann Arbor,
Michigan in June of 1998. NeuroreceptorMapping00 is scheduled to follow
the Society of Nuclear Medicine Annual Meeting (St. Louis; June 4-8,
2000).

Under the theme "Mapping Neuroreceptors at Work", the meeting will focus

on recent progress in imaging of neuronal activity. Topics will range
from measurement of neuronal metabolism and neurotransmission to the
estimation of neuroreceptor parameters in living brain using imaging
studies carried out either in humans or in animals. Papers will be
presented in both oral and poster formats.

The main topic areas for the symposium are:

Radiochemistry: Tracer Design and Selection
Neuroreceptor Interactions and Pharmacological Challenges
Neuropharmacological Imaging in Human Disease
Instrumentation for Neuroreceptor Mapping Studies
Tracer Kinetic Modeling in Neuroreceptor Mapping
Statistics and Signals in Neuroreceptor Mapping
Role of Neuroreceptor Imaging in New Drug Development
The Blood Brain Barrier
Receptor Internalization
›
All of these areas are crucial for the proper design and successful
accomplishment of the performance of neuropharmacological imaging
studies. The goal of the meeting is to bring together scientists in
these complementary disciplines of neuroscience, radiochemistry, and
medical imaging to consider the current and future directions of
functional neuroreceptor mapping.

We are eager to hear of your latest work in the area of Neuroreceptor
Mapping, and believe that, with your involvement, our organizing
committee will provide an intellectually stimulating meeting.

The abstract deadline is January 28, 2000.

Please feel free to forward this e-mail to others whom you think may be
interested in the meeting.

We have updated our web site for the symposium,

We will continue to update the web site as more detailed information
becomes available.

We sincerely hope to see you in New York next summer for
NeuroreceptorMapping00.
