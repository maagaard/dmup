Athens, Greece, JULY 4-8, 1999

Special Session on Control in Biological Systems

Session Organizer: Dr. Kamran Iqbal 


Biological systems comprise all living organism, in particular the vertebrates.
There has been a growing interest in the study of such systems since the early
work of Sherington (The integrative action of the nervous system,1906) .
Control in biological systems takes many forms, e.g., control of voluntary
movements, control of gait and posture, control of muscle tension and joint
stiffness, control of temperature, control of blood pressure, control of
respiratory system, etc. Biological control is exerted through commands
originating in the central nervous system, and is assisted by spinal reflexes
and a low level motor servo. The neuro-physiological controller can be termed
as autonomous, self-organizing, self-evolving, and hierarchical. 

Biological systems are distinguished by their complex and diverse nature.
Presence of nonlinear dynamics, multiple degrees-of-freedom, inter-segmental
couplings, controller and actuator redundancies, multiple levels of feedback,
finite feedback delays, and the distributed nature of parameters makes
modelling of biological systems a daunting task. The complexity inherent in
biological control systems has long challenged the researchers and often
precluded the use of many a powerful tools otherwise available to control
theorists. New and exciting additions to systems theory have often evolved from
study of biological systems, e.g., artificial neural networks.

The proposed session aims to explore the control issues relevant to the
biological systems. A non-exhaustive list of topics includes the following:
physiological and neuro-muscular system modeling, musculo-skeletal models,
biokinematics, biodynamics, biomechanics, motor control, motor learning,
neurological control of muscle activity, skeltomotor reflexes, control of limb
movement, control of posture and locomotion, control of skilled movements,
control of manipulative abilities, control of blood pressure,
respiratory/ventilatory control, biomedical applications of automatic control,
functional electrical and functional neuromuscular stimulation, evolutionary
approaches in biological systems, trajectory control of movements,
identification and computer simulation of biological systems.
