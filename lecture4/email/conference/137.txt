           VRML99
 
 the Fourth International Conference
 on the Virtual Reality Modeling
 Language and Web 3D Technologies


     http://www.c-lab.de/vrml99 

 Paderborn, Germany, 23-26 Feb 1999

############################################################################
    
The annual VRML Symposium is the worldwide most important event for 
the VRML and Web 3D community. Its purpose is to bring together
researchers, developers, product vendors, content creators and other
contributors interested in using or enhancing VRML and Web 3D
technology.
The first two days of the conference feature courses and workshops, 
the second two days peer-reviewed papers and panels. 

We encourage authors working with VRML, Java3D, Chromeffects,Metastreams 
and related standards to inform the community about advances in these 
areas by submitting their work or proposal to any of the events
described below. 

A variety of different social events will be organized during the
evenings. After the successful VRML95 (San Diego), VRML97 (Monterey)
and VRML98 (Monterey), VRML99 is being held for the first time in
Europe.


############################################################################

Papers


VRML99 will accept papers in the categories applications, research and
systems. All content must be innovative and important to the advancement
of VRML and Web 3D technologies. We will also accept a limited number of
position papers. Position papers should present visionary and
stimulating
ideas about the evolution of 3D Web technologies and how these
technologies
should be used. Papers will be reviewed by the international program
committee and should present unpublished original work. Papers can be
submitted in electronic form or in traditional print form. Submissions
should contain a title and abstract, as wells as the names, affiliations 
and email addresses of the authors. Regular papers should be at most
12 normally typeset pages including figures and references; position 
papers should be at most 6 pages. 

############################################################################

Videos


Video submissions complementing a technical paper will be given special
treatment in the video proceedings. Videos are to be considered for the
inclusion in a tape loop, which will run in the VRML99 lobby. For better
projection quality analog Betacam SP is the preferred video format, but
also VHS and SVHS (PAL and NTSC) are acceptable. 

############################################################################

Panels


VRML99 panels will ideally address current burning issues in the VRML
and
the Web 3D community. A good panel will be of interest to the audience, 
have informed, opinionated, controversial speakers and will be focused 
enough to have a coherent discussion. A panel proposal should contain a
title, motivation, as well as names, affiliations and email addresses of
potential panelists. 

############################################################################

Workshops and Courses


VRML99 is looking for a number of dynamic workshops and courses.
Workshop
participants will present work in progress or discuss current and future
trends. Courses should teach established or promising techniques and
uses of VRML and Web 3D technologies. A workshop proposal should contain
a
title, motivation and goals, a description of the format
(mini-conference,
Working Group meeting or other) and of the content (agenda or topic
list), as well as names, affiliations and email addresses of the chair
or
co-chairs. A course proposal should contain a title, motivation, table
of contents, format (half-day of full-day), as well as names,
affiliations
and email addresses of the tutor(s). In addition it should indicate
whether the course was given before and what kind of additional
material (e.g. lecture notes) will be provided for the audience. 

############################################################################

Web 3D RoundUP


Top 3D tools and content developers demonstrate latest Web 3D technology
and applications in a fast-paced, exciting format. Bleeding-edge 3D
applications on the Web including VRML, Java3D and Chrome will face
off Tuesday night at 6PM in a fast-paced competition in front of a
merciless audience. Contributors from all over the globe will have one
to four minutes to demonstrate their applications, many of which are
still in alpha development, and win over the crowd. Attendees at the
event are all armed with noisemakers (for approval and disapproval)
and the entire front row is equipped with Nerf launchers at the ready 
for demos that run overtime, taking the concept of demo or die to 
the next level. In less than an hour and a half, over 3 dozen new
ideas will be demonstrated to a technically demanding audience
intolerant
of marketing sizzle. This event played to a packed house at SIGGRAPH 96,
97
and 98, VRML 97 and 98, as the VRML DemoSIG. 

############################################################################

VRML Gallery and VRML.ART


The VRML Gallery features all submitted applications. This year for the 
first time we will have a focused section on art and we encourage
artists and commercial designers who work in VRML to submit their
material 
in digital form for the VRML.ART.

############################################################################

Exhibition


There will be an exhibition at VRML99. Similar conditions apply as on
previous conferences. We are looking for new products, innovative tools 
and other high-performance VRML and Web 3D technology.
