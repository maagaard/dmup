                SCHOOL ON NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING


                              ( 3 - 28 May 1999 )




        A School on Neural Information Processing will be held at the Abdus
Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, from 3 to 28
May 1999.  This Bulletin contains the preliminary programme of the course,
request for participation form and miscellaneous information.


        DIRECTORS:

    J.A. Hertz (NORDITA, Copenhagen)
    S.A. Solla (Northwestern University, Evanston)
    R. Zecchina (The Abdus Salam ICTP, Trieste)





I.      PURPOSE AND NATURE


        The goal of the school will be to present a systematic description
of the theoretical approaches that provide tools to investigate the
processing, transmission, and storage of information in the brain.
Techniques based on the principles of statistical physics and information
theory will be presented and applied to the analysis of a variety of
problems in computational neuroscience, especially neural encoding and
sensory processing.  The lectures will be concentrated on biological neural
networks, but will also cover some important developments in artificial
networks and optimization theory.
        The lectures presented during the school intend to offer a broad
and comprehensive training in order to provide a complete perspective of
the field.  In addition to the scheduled lectures (an average of 4 lectures
per day, 5 days per week) there will be formal and informal seminars on a
variety of research topics by lecturers, participants and visiting experts.
Computer experimentations will also be organized.




II.     PRELIMINARY LIST OF LECTURERS AND TOPICS

W. Bialek(NEC Research Institute, Princeton)Neural coding
M. Biehl (University of Wuerzburg)      The dynamics of learning
P. Dayan (University College, London)   Generative models
A. Engel (University of Magdeburg)      Statistical physics theory of learning
D. Hansel (Ecole Polytechnique, Paris)  Circuitry of the visual cortex
J. Hertz (Nordita, Copenhagen ) Neural computation and encoding
Li Zhaoping (University College, London)        Sensory processing
R. Monasson (Ecole Normale Superieure), Paris)  Optimization problems
J. Rinzel (New York University, New York)  Modelling of cell/network dynamics
T. Sejnowski (The Salk Institute, San Diego)    Neural computation and encoding
S. Solla(Northwestern University, Chicago)Neural networks for Bayesian inference
M. Tsodyks (The Weizmann Institute, Rehovot)    Synaptic dynamics
L. van Hemmen (Technical  University, Munich)   Modelling neural circuitry
R. Zecchina (ICTP, Trieste)                     Optimization problems



III.    PARTICIPATION

        Scientists and students from all countries that are members of the
United Nations, UNESCO or IAEA can attend the School.  The main purpose of
the Centre is to help research workers from developing countries through a
programme of training activities within a framework of international
cooperation.  However, students and post-doctoral scientists from developed
countries are most welcome to attend.  As the School will be conducted in
English, participants should have an adequate working knowledge of that
language.
        Participants should preferably have completed several years of
study and research after a first degree.  Applications from graduate
students about to finish their PhD, fresh post-docs and young, active
faculty members are encouraged.
        As a rule, travel and subsistence expenses of the participants are
borne by the home institutions.  However, some funds are available which
permit the Centre to grant a subsistence allowance to a limited number of
people from developing countries who will be selected by the Organizers.
As scarcity of funds allows travel to be granted only in few exceptional
cases, every effort should be made by candidates to secure support for
their fares (or at least partial fare) by their home country.  Such
financial support is available only to those attending the entire School.
Scientists from developed countries are welcome to join on their own funds.
There is no registration fee for attending the School.

Deadline for the RECEIPT of request for participation form:     20 January 1999
