ANNOUNCEMENT / CALL FOR PAPERS

WORLD MANUFACTURING CONGRESS (WMC'97)
http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/icsc/wmc97.htm

November 18-21, 1997
Auckland, New Zealand

WMC'97 is dedicated to Philip Crosby

- ICSC
- Massey University

************************************


PURPOSE OF THE CONGRESS

The continuous exchange of scientific information is of particular
importance in a time of world-wide problems in the manufacturing industry.
The impact of other rapidly changing technical sectors, such as electronics,
automation and computer engineering, combined with the increasing pressures
from issues such as environmental protection and global markets, is
revolutionizing both the philosophies and the production elements of
manufacturing.

The World Manufacturing Congress, to be held every two years, is designed to
be a forum for academia and industry to exchange ideas for research and to
facilitate the transfer of such ideas into practice. The key objective of
the congress is to cover all relevant aspects of the developing science of
manufacturing systems, manufacturing technology and manufacturing
management, including strategies, operational and organizational factors,
new and developing technologies, information management and human factors in
the industrial environment.
Amongst the more traditional application areas, WMC'97 will pay particular
attention and examine the impact of manufacturing on a variety of important
industrial sectors. These sectors include Aerospace, Automotive, Biomedical,
Pharmaceutical, Nuclear, Health and the Environment, Textile and Footwear,
Defense, Electronics, Communication, Agricultural, Food, and Construction
industries.

The papers accepted for presentation will be those of a high standard of
content and presentation and offering new ideas and original research to the
audience.

************************************


INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS (ISMS'97)

The aim of ISMS'97 is the cross-fertilization of ideas and knowledge about
manufacturing systems. ISMS'97 will bring together industrialists, research
institutions and universities to present new research results, exchange
ideas and experiences and to identify the future trend in the field of
manufacturing systems. 

The tentative list of topics includes, but is not limited to:

- Automation in Agriculture
- Construction as a Manufacturing Process

************************************


INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MANUFACTURING MANAGEMENT (ISMM'97)

Manufacturing management is an instrument of survival against ever
increasing global competitiveness. ISMM'97 will cover all aspects of
manufacturing management. The theme of the symposia will place a stronghold
on principles and concepts and how these are affected by the different
operational ways in which a manufacturing organization can meet its
strategic objectives.
