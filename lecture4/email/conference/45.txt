Dear NPIV 97 author,

Below are some more details about the NPIV 97 workshop.


1) By now you should have registered for the conference at the
author rate of $250 (deadline was October 15).  Please contact
Dr. E.K. Park (registration chair) with any registration questions:
	ekpark@cstp.umkc.edu

2) For the version of the paper to be included in the proceedings
distributed on-site, we can use the paper you already submitted, or
you can revise it and send us a new version by Friday, October 24
1997. For best formatting when printed, a Postscript or PDF file is
preferred; however, HTML is acceptable. Please email the new version
to me, or if the file is extremely large (several MB), make it
available at a web address and we will retrieve it. The on-site
proceedings will be black and white photocopied papers.

3) You will have a chance to update your paper after the workshop for
inclusion in the Workshop proceedings distributed by ACM.

4) Your on-site presentation should be a 20 minute talk followed by a
10 minute question and answer period. The workshop schedule is now
available at
 http://www.cs.umbc.edu/conferences/cikm/npiv/npiv97_schedule.html 


If you have any more questions, please feel to contact us. 

Sincerely,

David Ebert and Charles Nicholas
NPIV 97 Co-Chairs
