WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES
The main goal of the workshop is to assess the state of the art of the
theory and the applications of multiple classifier systems and related
approaches. Contributions from all the research communities working in the
field are welcome in order to compare the different approaches and to
define the common research priorities. Special attention is also devoted to
assess the applications of multiple classifier systems and the potential
market perspectives. The workshop program will include both plenary
lectures given by invited speakers and papers accepted for oral
presentation. The papers will be published in the workshop proceedings, and
extended versions of selected papers will be considered for publication in
a special issue of the Pattern Analysis and Applications Journal on
Classifier Fusion

WORKSHOP TOPICS
Papers describing original work in the following and related research
topics are welcome:

Theoretical foundations of multiple classifier systems
Methods for classifier combination
Methods for classifier selection
Neural network ensembles
Modular neural networks
Mixture models
Multiple expert systems
Hybrid systems
Learning in multiple classifier systems
Design of multiple classifier systems
Multiple models in data mining
Related approaches (intelligent agents, multi-criteria decision making,
etc.)
Applications (biometrics, document analysis, data mining, remote sensing,
etc.)
