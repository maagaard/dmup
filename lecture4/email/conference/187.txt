                       Modern Science and the Mind
                         January 19-May 15, 1999

           an interdisciplinary online graduate course offered by
                           Consciousness Studies 
                        at The University of Arizona
                URL: www.consciousness.arizona.edu/msm.html



            MODERN SCIENCE AND THE MIND (MSM) is a Web-based
 course aiming to provide its participants with a broad 
 appreciation for the present status of science as it applies to 
 the relationship between brain and mind. Relevant aspects of 
 physical, biological, and cognitive science are described 
 in a style appropriate for a general audience, followed by an 
 appraisal of current debates in consciousness science and 
 suggestions for where it may be going in the future. 

 Since the immense intricacies of real biological, psychological, 
 and social phenomena are often overlooked in consciousness 
 discussions, MSM will lead the participants through some of 
 the realities of these areas, clarifying certain misunderstandings 
 and underscoring aspects that are yet poorly understood. 

 Throughout the course, a sincere effort will be made to avoid 
 overselling the fruits of science and to suggest the limits beyond 
 which science---as it is currently conceived---may not be a 
 useful guide. The ways that science may be expected to 
 modify its tools in the coming century are considered at the 
 close of MSM.

 MSM is organized around 15 presentations of about 3,000 words 
 each, carefully prepared by the course leader. Written in a lively and 
 reader-friendly style that avoids both technical jargon and mathematical 
 formulas, these presentations will feature many links to related Web
 sites, thereby enabling each participant to gain a broad appreciation 
 for the scope of present research activities in consciousness science.
 MSM is being offered on a credit or non-credit basis.

 The course organizer is Dr. Alwyn Scott, a professor in the Department of 
 Mathematics at The University of Arizona and in the Department of 
 Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark. 
 He is a founding editor of Physica D.: Nonlinear Phenomena, and the 
 founding director of the Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Los Alamos 
 National Laboratories.  

 Distinguished thinkers in the areas of physical science, biology, social
 science, and consciousness studies have agreed to provide comments on the
 presentations and engage in discussion with the MSM participants.  This 
 group will include, among others:

 David Chalmers (philosopher) 
 Rodney Cotterill (physicist) 
 Stuart Hameroff (physician) 
 Alfred Kaszniak (psychologist) 
 Margaret Kidwell (biologist)
 Christof Koch (neuroscientist) 
 John Pickering (psychologist)
 Michael Winkelman (anthropologist)
