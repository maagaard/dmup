ABSTRACT:  We study the effect of various transfer functions on the 
properties of a time series generated by a continuous-valued 
feed-forward network in which the next input vector is determined from 
past output values. 
The parameter space for monotonic and non-monotonic transfer functions
is analyzed in the unstable regions with the following main finding;
non-monotonic functions can produce robust chaos whereas monotonic functions
generate fragile chaos only. In the case of non-monotonic functions, 
the number of positive Lyapunov exponents increases as a function of one 
of the free parameters in the model, hence, high dimensional chaotic 
attractors can be generated. We extend the analysis to a combination 
of monotonic and non-monotonic functions.
