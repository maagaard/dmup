Applications and Science of Computational Intelligence III (OR16)

On-site Proceedings. Abstracts for this conference are due by 13 September 1999.
Manuscripts are due by 31 January 2000. 

Conference Chairs: Kevin L. Priddy, Battelle Memorial Institute; Paul E. Keller,
Battelle/Pacific Northwest National Lab.; David B. Fogel, Natural Selection,
Inc.  Program Committee: Shun-ichi Amari, RIKEN (Japan); Stanley C. Ahalt, The
Ohio State Univ.; Peter J. Angeline, Natural Selection, Inc.; Gianfranco Basti,
Pontifical Lateran Univ. (Italy); James C. Bezdek, Univ. of West Florida; Bruno

The focus of this conference is on real-world applications of computational
intelligence (neural networks, fuzzy logic, and/or evolutionary computation) and
on recent theoretical developments (principal components analysis/independent
components analysis, etc.) applicable to current problem domains. The goal is to
provide a forum for interaction between researchers and industrial/ government
agencies with information processing requirements. Sessions containing papers
from the different disciplines in related applications will be the highlight of
this conference. Papers that investigate advantages/disadvantages of
computational intelligence solutions in specific real-world applications will be
presented as oral and posters. The poster session will contain papers by the
session chairs to allow interaction by attendees in small groups. Papers that
clearly state existing problems in information processing that could potentially
be solved by computational intelligence techniques will also be considered.
Sessions will concentrate on:  comparative performance in applications of target
recognition, object recognition, speech processing, speaker identification,
co-channel processing, signal processing in realistic environments, robotics,
process control, and image processing  demonstrations of properties and
limitations of existing or new computational intelligence techniques as shown by
or related to an application  environments for development of computational
intelligence solutions  hardware implementation technologies that are either
general purpose or application specific  knowledge acquisition and
representation  physiologically motivated information processing and
representation  independent component analyses (ICA) generalizing principal
component analyses (PCA)  innovative applications of computational intelligence
to solve real-world problems with Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC).  

Special Instructions to Authors  Oral Presentations are scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday with poster sessions scheduled Tuesday evening.  On the occasion of
NASA's 40th Anniversary, Wednesday will be devoted to joint sessions on Remote
Sensing using both Computational Intelligence and Wavelet Analysis. 

Honorary co-chairs: William J. Campbell, Milton Halem, NASA Goddard Space Flight
Ctr.  Due to the limited number of oral sessions, we cannot accommodate requests
for oral-only presentations without prior approval of the Conference Chair. Any
program committee member can guarantee acceptance of brief oral overviews
followed by poster interactive presentations. Poster submission will be
encouraged with the popup short talks and the Best Poster Award. There will be
no differentiation between poster and oral papers in the proceedings.  Please
indicate your preference for oral or poster sessions.
