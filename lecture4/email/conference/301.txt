INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ON NEURAL NETS <<E.R. CAIANIELLO>>

4th Course: Subsymbolic Computation in Artificial Intelligence

ERICE-SICILY: October 24-31, 1999


Motivations

Autonomous intelligent agents that perform complex real world
tasks must be able to build and process rich internal
representations that allow them to effectively draw inferences,
make decisions, and, in general, perform reasoning processes
concerning their own tasks.

Within the computational framework of artificial intelligence
(AI) this problem has been faced in different ways. According to
the classical, symbolic approach, internal representations are
conceived in terms of linguistic structures, as expressions of a
"language of thought". Other traditions developed approaches
that are less linguistically oriented, and more biologically and
anatomically motivated. It is the case of neural networks, and of
self-organizing and evolutionary algorithms.
Empirical results concerning natural intelligent systems suggest
that such approaches are not fully incompatible, and that
different kinds of representation may interact. Similarly, it can be
argued that the design of artificial intelligent systems can take
advantage from different kinds of interacting representations,
that are suited for different tasks.

In this perspective, theoretical frameworks and methodological
techniques are needed, that allow to employ together in a
principled way different kinds of representation. In particular,
autonomous agents need to find the meaning for the symbols
they use within their internal processes and in the interaction
with the external world, thus overcoming the well-known symbol
grounding problem.

An information processing architecture for autonomous
intelligent agents should exhibit processes that act on suitable
intermediate levels, which are intermediary among sensory
data, symbolic level, and actions. These processes could be
defined in terms of subsymbolic computation paradigms, such
as neural networks, self-organizing, and evolutionary
algorithms.
