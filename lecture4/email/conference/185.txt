IEEE Visualization 1999
Celebrating Ten Years

October 24 - October 29, 1999
San Francisco Airport Hyatt
San Francisco, California, USA

Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Computer Graphics In Cooperation with ACM/SIGGRAPH

VISUALIZATION is a vital research and applications frontier
shared by a variety of science, medical, engineering, business,
and entertainment fields. The tenth IEEE Visualization conference
focuses on interdisciplinary methods. Collaboration among developers
and users of visualization methods across all of science, engineering,
medicine, and commerce is addressed at Visualization '99. Sunday through
Tuesday of Conference Week will include tutorials, symposia, and
mini-workshops. Papers, panels, case studies, and late-breaking hot
topics will be presented Wednesday through Friday.

We invite you to participate in IEEE Visualization '99 by submitting
your original research through papers, panels, case studies, late
breaking hot topics, and demonstrations. Share your perspectives
through panels and workshops, or your experience through tutorials.
Please select the forum
appropriate to your submission, where it will be considered by your
peers for presentation. Particular focus on parallel techniques in
visualization and information visualization are addressed in special
two-day symposia.

For further information on the conference or evolving symposia contact:

submission details at http://www.erc.msstate.edu/vis99


Conference Papers
(due March 31, 1999)
Papers are solicited that present research results related to
all areas of visualization. Original papers are limited to
5,000 words. The submission of NTSC VHS video (up to 5 minutes
in length) to accompany the paper is strongly recommended.
Please submit 7 copies of all materials to Bernd Hamann (at the
address below). Accepted papers will
be included in the conference proceedings; the videos will be
included in the conference video proceedings.  In addition, we
MUST receive, by submission deadline, a complete paper submission
form.
Paper submissions (hard copy only) should be sent to Bernd
Hamann, Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing,
2343 Academic Surge Building, One Shields Avenue, University
of California, Davis, Davis, CA 95616-8553, USA

Panel Proposals
(due March 31, 1999)
Panels should address the most important issues in visualization
today. Panel proposals should describe the topic to be addressed
and identify the prospective panelists. Each panelist should
include a position statement on the topic and a short biography
(limit 500 words for both per panelist). The statements will be
included in the conference proceedings.
Panel proposals should (hard copy or email) be sent to J. Edward
Swan, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 5580, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW
Washington, D.C. 20375-5320, USA. 202-404-4984. Fax: 202-767-1122.

Case Study Papers
(due March 31, 1999)
Case studies are reports on how visualization has contributed to the
analysis of data. They may have an application focus or relate to
the visualization process.  Possible application areas include
physical, life, social and information sciences, engineering, and
commerce. An emphasis on lessons learned from practical experience
is strongly encouraged, particularly where visualization has been
employed in a real, working environment. A short paper limited to
2500 words (maximum 4 pages B/W plus 1 page color) will be included
in the conference proceedings. Images and/or NTSC VHS video to
accompany the paper are recommended; the video will be included in
the conference videotape. Submit six copies of all materials.
Case study submissions (hard copy only) should be sent to David Kao,
NASA Ames Research Center, M/S T27A-2, Moffett Field CA 94035-1000,
USA. davidkao@nas.nasa.gov

Late Breaking Hot Topics Papers
(due June 15, 1999)
Submissions will be accepted on Late Breaking Hot Topics that pertain
to all areas of Visualization. These submissions must be original, may
show work in progress, and may not exceed 1000 words or a maximum
of 4 pages including images. Images and/or NTSC VHS video to accompany the
paper are recommended; the video will be included in the conference
video proceedings. Accepted papers will be published and distributed
at the conference. Authors of accepted papers will have an opportunity
to submit a revised paper. Submissions will be done electronically.
Submission details can be found at the conference web site or by
contracting Craig Wittenbrink at craig_wittenbrink@hpl.hp.com
Videotape should be send to Craig M. Wittenbrink, Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories, 1501 Page Mill Rd, MS3U-4, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1126, USA.
650-857-2329. Fax: 650-852-3791

Tutorial Proposals
(due March 31, 1999)
Tutorials are full or half-day presentations designed to cover specific
visualization methods or application areas in depth. Subjects can
include, but not limited to, standard visualization techniques, existing
languages or toolkits, and mathematical fundamentals, databases,
usability analysis, or commercialization of software. It is the intention
of the Vise '99 tutorial committee to provide one classroom equipped with
workstations for hands-on instruction. Tutorials proposing to use this
interactive classroom should clearly state this preference and how the
course is designed for this setting. For more detailed information
concerning submission and format content, see the conference web site,
or contact Kelly Gaither, Mississippi State University, P.O. Box 9627,
Mississippi State University, MS 39762, USA. 601-325-2067.
Fax: 601-325-7692. kelly@erc.msstate.edu

Mini-Workshop and Birds-of-a-Feather Proposals
(due March 31, 1999)
Proposals may be submitted for Mini-Workshops and evening
Birds-Of-A-Feather (BOF) gathering on visualization methods or
application areas. They should deal with state-of-the-art topics
and involve experts in the field. Discipline-focused proposals
devoted to a particular discipline's methods and needs are
encouraged.
Mini-Workshop and Birds-of-a-Feather Proposals (hard copy or email)
should be sent to Rob Erbacher, University of Idaho, Department of
Computer Science, Moscow, ID 83844-1010, USA, erbacher@cs.uidaho.edu

Demonstration Proposals
Visualization '99 is a unique opportunity to present your products or
research to visualization experts from a wide variety of fields. We
invite demonstrations of commercial hardware, software, integrated
systems peripherals, and literature, as well as academic research.
We encourage demonstrators to have technical representatives in attendance.
For more information on participating in Visualization '99
demonstrations, contact Upul Obeysekare at obey@ctc.com
