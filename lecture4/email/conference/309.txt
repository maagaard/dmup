----------------------------------------------------

Technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Neural Networks Council, the IEEE
Region 8, the IEEE Benelux Section, and the International Neural Networks
Society.

The call for papers for the ESANN'2000 conference is now available on the
Web:
       http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esann
For those of you who maintain WWW pages including lists of related ANN
sites: we would appreciate if you could add the above URL to your list;
thank you very much!

We try as much as possible to avoid multiple sendings of this call for
papers; however please apologize if you receive this e-mail twice, despite
our precautions.

You will find below a short version of this call for papers, without the
instructions to authors (available on the Web).  If you have difficulties to
connect to the Web please send an e-mail to
        esann@dice.ucl.ac.be
and we will send you a full version of the call for papers.

ESANN'2000 is organised in collaboration with the UCL (Universite catholique
de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve) and the KULeuven (Katholiek Universiteit
Leuven).


Scope and topics
----------------
Since its first edition in 1993, the European Symposium on Artificial Neural
Networks has become the reference for researchers on fundamentals and
theoretical aspects of artificial neural networks. Each year, around 100
specialists attend ESANN, in order to present their latest results and
comprehensive surveys, and to discuss the future developments in this field.

The ESANN'2000 conference will focus on fundamental aspects of ANNs: theory,
models, learning algorithms, mathematical aspects, approximation of
functions, classification, control, time-series prediction, statistics,
signal processing, vision, self-organization, vector quantization, evolutive
learning, psychological computations, biological plausibility, etc.  Papers
on links and comparisons between ANNs and other domains of research (such as
statistics, data analysis, signal processing, biology, psychology, evolutive
learning, bio-inspired systems, etc.) are also encouraged.

Papers will be presented orally (no parallel sessions) and in poster
sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation
during a plenary session. It is important to mention that it is the topics
of the paper which will decide if it better fits into an oral or a poster
session, not its quality. The selection of posters will be identical to oral
presentations, and both will be printed in the same way in the proceedings.
Nevertheless, authors have the choice to indicate on the author submission
form that they only accept to present their paper orally.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics covered during the ESANN
conferences:
o theory
o models and architectures
o mathematics
o learning algorithms
o vector quantization
o self-organization
o RBF networks
o Bayesian classification
o recurrent networks
o support vector machines
o time series forecasting
o adaptive control
o statistical data analysis
o independent component analysis
o signal processing
o approximation of functions
o cellular neural networks
o fuzzy neural networks
o natural and artificial vision
o hybrid networks
o identification of non-linear dynamic systems
o biologically plausible artificial networks
o bio-inspired systems
o neurobiological  systems
o cognitive psychology
o adaptive behaviour
o evolutive learning

Special sessions
----------------
Special sessions will be organized by renowned scientists in their
respective fields. Papers submitted to these sessions are reviewed according
to the same rules as any other submission. Authors who submit papers to one
of these sessions are invited to mention it on the author submission form;
nevertheless, submissions to the special sessions must follow the same
format, instructions and deadlines as any other submission, and must be sent
to the same address.

Location
--------

The conference will be held in Bruges (also called "Venice of the North"),
one of the most beautiful medieval towns in Europe.  Bruges can be reached
by train from Brussels in less than one hour (frequent trains).  The town of
Bruges is world-wide known, and famous for its architectural style, its
canals, and its pleasant atmosphere.

The conference will be organised in an hotel located near the centre
(walking distance) of the town. There is no obligation for the participants
to stay in this hotel. Hotels of all level of comfort and price are
available in Bruges; there is a possibility to book a room in the hotel of
the conference, or in another one (50 m. from the first one) at a
preferential rate through the conference secretariat. A list of other
smaller hotels is also available.

The conference will be held at the Novotel hotel, Katelijnestraat 65B, 8000
Brugge, Belgium.

Call for contributions
----------------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit
- six original copies of their manuscript (including at least two originals
or very good copies without glued material, which will be used for the
proceedings)
- one signed copy of the author submission form
before December 10, 1999.  Authors are invited to join a floppy disk or CD
with their contribution in (generic) PostScript or PDF format. Sorry,
electronic or fax submissions are not accepted.

Working language of the conference (including proceedings) is English.  The
instructions to authors, together with the author submission form, are
available on the ESANN Web server:
       http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esann
A printed version of these documents is also available through the
conference secretariat (please use email if possible).  Authors are invited
to follow the instructions to authors.  A LaTeX style file is also available
on the Web.

Authors must indicate their choice for oral or poster presentation on the
author submission form.  They must also sign a written agreement that they
will register to the conference and present the paper in case of acceptation
of their submission.  Authors of accepted papers will have to register
before February 28, 2000.  They will benefit from the advance registration
fee.

Submissions must be sent to:
