UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

OXFORD SUMMER SCHOOL ON CONNECTIONIST MODELLING

Department of Experimental Psychology
University of Oxford

18th - 30th July 1999


Applications are invited for participation in a 2-week residential
Summer School on techniques in connectionist modelling.  The course is
aimed primarily at researchers who wish to exploit neural network
models in their teaching and/or research and it will provide a general
introduction to connectionist modelling, biologically plausible neural
networks and brain function through lectures and exercises on
Macintosh's and PC's.  The course  is interdisciplinary in content
though many of the illustrative examples are taken from cognitive and
developmental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience.  The instructors
with primary responsibility for teaching the course are Kim Plunkett
and Edmund Rolls.

No prior knowledge of computational modelling will be required though
simple word processing skills will be assumed.  Participants will be
encouraged to start work on their own modelling projects during the
Summer School.

The cost of participation in the Summer School is stlg950. This figure
covers the cost of accommodation (bed and breakfast at St. John's
College), registration and all literature required for the Summer
School.  Participants will be expected to cover their own travel and
meal costs.  A number of partial bursaries will be available for
graduate students.  Applicants should indicate whether they wish to be
considered for a graduate student scholarship but are advised to seek
further funding as well, since in previous years the number of
graduate student applications has far exceeded the number of
scholarships available.

There is a Summer School World Wide Web page describing the contents
of the 1999 Summer School available on: 
http://www-cogsci.psych.ox.ac.uk/summer-school/ Further information
about contents of the course can be obtained from
Steven.Young@psy.ox.ac.uk

If you are interested in participating in the Summer School, please

Please send a brief description of your background with an explanation
of why you would like to attend the Summer School (one page maximum)
no later than 31st January 1999.
