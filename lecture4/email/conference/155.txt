**** FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS ****
*******************************

1999 IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing
August 23-25, 1999, Madison, Wisconsin

NNSP'99 homepage: http://eivind.imm.dtu.dk/nnsp99

Thanks to the sponsorship of IEEE Signal Processing Society the ninth
of a series of IEEE workshops on Neural Networks for Signal Processing
will be held at the Concourse Hotel, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.
The workshop will feature keynote addresses, technical presentations,
panel discussions and special sessions. Papers are solicited for, but
not limited to, the following areas:

Paradigms:
Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, Markov models,
graphical models, dynamical systems, evolutionary computation,
nonlinear signal processing, and wavelets.

Application Areas:
Image/speech/multimedia processing, intelligent human computer
interfaces, intelligent agents, blind source separation, OCR, robotics,
adaptive filtering, communications, sensors, system identification,
issues related to RWC, and other general signal processing and pattern
recognition.

Theories:
Generalization, design algorithms, optimization, parameter estimation,
and network architectures.

Implementations:
Parallel and distributed implementation, hardware design, and other
general implementation technologies.


SPECIAL SESSIONS
The workshop features special sessions on
* Support vector machines
* Intelligent human computer interfaces


PAPER SUBMISSION PROCEDURE
Prospective authors are invited to submit 5 copies of extended
summaries of no more than 6 pages.  The top of the first page of the
summary should include a title, authors' names, affiliations, address,
telephone and fax numbers and email address.
Camera-ready full papers of accepted proposals will be published in
a hard-bound volume by IEEE and distributed at the workshop.
