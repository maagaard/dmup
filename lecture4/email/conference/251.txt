COURSE ANNOUNCEMENT

What:
  "The NEURON Simulation Environment"
  (1999 NEURON Summer Course)

When:
  Saturday, July 31, through Wednesday, August 4, 1999

Where:
  San Diego Supercomputer Center
  University of California at San Diego, CA

Organizers:
  N.T. Carnevale and M.L. Hines

Faculty includes:
  N.T. Carnevale, M.L. Hines, W.W. Lytton, and T.J. Sejnowski

Description:
This intensive hands-on course covers the design, 
construction, and use of models in the NEURON simulation 
environment. It is intended primarily for those who are 
concerned with models of biological neurons and neural 
networks that are closely linked to empirical observations, 
e.g. experimentalists who wish to incorporate modeling in 
their research plans, and theoreticians who are interested 
in the principles of biological computation. The course is 
designed to be useful and informative for registrants at 
all levels of experience, from those who are just beginning 
to those who are already quite familiar with NEURON or 
other simulation tools.

Registration is limited to 20 and the deadline is 
Thursday, July 1, 1999.
