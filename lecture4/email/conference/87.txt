IEE Colloquium on  "Neural Networks in Multimedia Interactive Systems"

Thursday 22 October 1998, Savoy Place, London.

Call for Papers
- ---------------

The IEE are holding a colloquium at Savoy Place on the use of neural
network models in multimedia systems. This is a developing field of
importance to both Multimedia applications developers who want to develop
more responsive and adaptive systems as well as to neural network
researchers.

The aim of the colloquium is to present a range of current neural network
applications in the area of interactive multimedia. The aim is cover a
range of topics including learning, intelligent agents within multimedia
systems, data mining, image processing and intelligent application
interfaces.

Invited Speakers:
- -----------------

Bruce Blumberg, MIT Media Lab.
Jim Austin, York.
Russell Beale, Birmingham.


Call For Papers
- ---------------

Submissions are invited in any (but not exclusively) of the following
areas:

Adaptive and plastic behaviour in multi-media systems
Concept and behaviour learning and acquisition
Browsing mechanisms
Preference and strategy identification and learning
Data mining
Image processing in multimedia systems
Cross modal and media representations and processes
Intelligent agents

Interested parties are invited to submit a two page (maximum) abstract of
their proposed talk to either
