LECTURESHIP IN NEURAL NETWORKS

University of York, UK.

Closing date 12 July 1999.


Applications are invited for a Lectureship, available
immediately, in any aspect of neural networks,
including such areas as hardware implementation, parallel
processing, cognitive aspects, modelling,
and theory. You will join the Advanced Computer
Architectures Group within the Department of
Computer Science one of the UKs leading groups working
in neural networks and a Department with
the highest rating in research and teaching. The Group
undertakes research in all the theory,
implementation and application of neural networks,
with over 10 researchers active in this area. The
group attracts funds from many government sources
including EPSRC and EU, as well as working with
a number of industries including British Aerospace,
The Post Office, Porta Systems and Glaxo-
Welcome. The group is also well known for its work
in the hardware implementation of neural
networks with extensive support for this aspect of
our research. The groups facilities include a SGI
Origin 2000 32 node supercomputer, high performance
workstations and a very supportive research culture.

An associated post is also available in
Computer Vision (see web below).
