Two-year graduate studentship on a computational neuroscience project

Department of Computer Science, University College Dublin, Ireland

The Cortical Software Re-Use (CSRU) project is a two-year
interdisciplinary project involving the Departments of Mathematical
Physics, Psychology, and Computer Science.  Its aim is to apply a
dynamical systems approach to modelling cortical computation with a
specific focus on frontal lobe function.

The Department of Computer Science at University College Dublin has
funding of â‚¬12,700 per year for two years for an MSc or PhD
student to work on the project.  The ideal candidate will have a
background in computer science and some experience of computational
modelling in the neuroscience area.

For further details, contact Ronan.Reilly@ucd.ie.
