The University of Southern California (USC) Department of Computer Science
(http://www.usc.edu/dept/cs/) invites applications for tenure-track positions
from outstanding candidates in Machine Learning. Exceptional candidates in
other areas of Artificial Intelligence (and Computer Science) may also be
considered. We are particularly seeking candidates with strong collaborative
inclinations.

USC's Intelligent Systems Group comprises faculty both on the main
campus and at USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI). It ranks
fourth overall in terms of AAAI Fellows and includes the current Chair
of SIGART along with two former chairs. Research topics include
collaborative agents, computational neuroscience, educational
technology, knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, learning,
natural language processing, neural networks, ontologies, planning,
robotics, virtual humans, and vision.  The computer science community
at USC is similarly large and diverse, with emphases in addition to
intelligent systems in such areas as algorithms and cryptography,
computer architecture, databases and information management, genomics
& DNA computing, graphics and multi-media, networking,
neuroinformatics, and software engineering. The broader computer
science community includes not only the Computer Science Department,
the Computer Engineering Program and ISI but also the Integrated Media
Systems Center (IMSC), an NSF Engineering Research Center focusing on
computer interfaces, information management and media communications;
and the newly created Institute for Creative Technologies that brings
together expertise from USC's Schools of Engineering,
Cinema-Television, and Communications (Annenberg) plus the
entertainment industry, to develop the art and technology for
compellingly realistic virtual experiences.

If interested, please send a comprehensive resume, a list of
references, and a statement of goals to: Paulina Tagle, Computer
Science, USC SAL 300, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0781
(paulina@pollux.usc.edu). USC is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative
Action Employer and encourages applications from women and minorities.
