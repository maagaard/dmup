------------------------------------------
    Position for a Ph.D. student in
   *Synthetic modeling / Biorobotics*
   at the AILab, University of Zurich
------------------------------------------

A new Ph.D. student position is open at the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, Dept. of Computer Science of the University of Zurich.
Availability: Immediately or at earliest convenience.

Research on this position will focus on "Synthetic modeling" or
"Biorobotics". "Synthetic modeling" is a novel biological methodology to
gain insights in the mechanisms underlying the behavior of biological
agents. Models developed to explain the animal's abilities are
implemented on an artifical agent and validated by observing the
behavior and the internal states of the robot. At the same time, the
method will lead to new solutions for robotics applications.

The specific goal of the project is to improve our understanding of the
impressive visual navigation abilities of insects and to apply this
knowledge to enable robots to safely navigate in complex environments.
This will require scaling-up of previous theoretical and practical work.

If the above challenges capture your interest, and you would like to
become a member of an international research team conducting
interdisciplinary work, submit a curriculum vitae, statement of research
interests, and names of three referees to:

Corinne Maurer
Dept. of Computer Science
