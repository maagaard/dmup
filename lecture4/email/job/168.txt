TWO POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS
-------------------------------------

There are two postdoctoral research fellowships at the NCRG available for 
October 1999 or as soon as possible thereafter.

***  Full details at http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/  ***

1.    Analysis of Learning in Support Vector Machines
      -----------------------------------------------

The Neural Computing Research Group at Aston is looking for a highly
motivated individual for a 2 year postdoctoral research position in
the area of `Analysis of Learning in Support Vector Machines'. The
emphasis of the research will be on applying a theoretically
well-founded approach based on methods adopted from statistical
mechanics to analyse learning in support vector machines.

Potential candidates should have strong mathematical and computational
skills, with a background in statistical mechanics and support vector
machines.

Conditions of Service
---------------------

Salaries will be up to point 11 on the RA 1A scale, currently 21,815
UK pounds. The salary scale is subject to annual increments.


How to Apply
------------

If you wish to be considered for this Fellowship, please send a full
CV and publications list, including full details and grades of
academic qualifications, together with the names of 3 referees, to:

    Dr. Manfred Opper
    Neural Computing Research Group
    School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
    Aston University
    Birmingham B4 7ET, U.K.
    Tel: 0121 333 4631
    Fax: 0121 333 4586
    e-mail: opperm@aston.ac.uk

e-mail submission of postscript files is welcome.


Closing date: 13 September, 1999.

===========================================================================

2.    Searching for Patterns in Activity across Multiple Targets
      ----------------------------------------------------------

This 3 year post aims to develop novel data visualisation and modelling
techniques for analysing large biological activity databases.  The work
will be carried out together with a PhD student funded by Pfizer.  Candidates
should have strong mathematical and computational skills; a background
in biological sciences would be an advantage.

Conditions of Service
---------------------

Salaries will be up to point 6 on the RA 1A scale, currently 17,570 UK
pounds per annum. The salary scale is subject to annual increments.
