<bold>Functional MRI Postdoctoral Position

School of Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience

University of Groningen, The Netherlands


</bold>A two-year post-doctoral fellowship to start as soon as possible.  The 
candidate should have some experience with neuroimaging, preferably using 
functional magnetic resonance imaging applied to an area of 
neurology/neuropsychology/neurolinguistics. Expertise in either the 
methodology itself or in the statistical analysis of such data is desired or 
equivalent experience which can readily be extended for use with this 
methodology.


The focus of the project is the use of the neuro-imaging technique of functional 
MRI to investigate the processing of language by normal adults and by groups 
with various language processing problems.  The postdoctoral fellow will 
function as part of a tema with responsibility for developing the methodology to 
be applied in such studies and analyzing experimental data.  The experiments 
will be coordinated with other research within the project, with the goal of 
developing a set of paradigms which can be applied across a variety of 
neurological conditions to extend our knowledge of the variation within within 
the neuroanatomy of language processing.


To apply, send a cv and letters of recommendation, and references to articles 
available viainternet to L.A.Stowe@let.rug.nl.  The letters of recommendation 
may also be electronic.  If you wish to apply by mail, use the address below.
