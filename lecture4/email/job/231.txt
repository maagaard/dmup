           FACULTY POSITION IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE
                             UC DAVIS


The Center for Neuroscience and the Department of Psychology at the
University of California, Davis, invite applications for a Cognitive
Neuroscientist at the assistant, associate or full professor level to
begin July 1, 2000.  Specialization within the area of cognitive
neuroscience is open, however, we are particularly interested in
faculty who work on some aspect of human neurophysiology and can
utilize newly established functional brain imaging facilities.  Those
who apply computational modeling approaches toward understanding
cognitive aspects of brain function are also encouraged to apply.
Applicants are expected to demonstrate leadership in their research
specialty, ability to obtain extramural funds, and ability to teach
cognitive neuroscience courses at both graduate and undergraduate
levels.  Candidates must possess a Ph.D. degree.  The Center for
Neuroscience is in the midst of rapid growth, and the successful
applicant will have the opportunity to participate in the recruitment
of additional positions in cognitive neuroscience.

The University of California, Davis, is an affirmative action/equal
opportunity employer with a strong institutional commitment to the
development of a climate that supports equality of opportunity and
respect for differences. Applicants should send a letter describing
