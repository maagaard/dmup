POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH, NIH 
INTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAM, BETHESDA, MD

The Unit on Integrative Neuroimaging within the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch
of the National Institute of Mental Health Intramural Research Program has an
immediate opening for a postdoctoral fellow at the Bethesda campus of the
National Institutes of Health.  This is a full-time research position which will
last from two to five years.  The position is open to U.S. and non-U.S. citizens
who are 1) recent Ph.D.'s in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroscience,
neuropharmacology, computer science, or other applicable discipline or 2) M.D.'s
with residency training in psychiatry, neurology, nuclear medicine, radiology or
other relevant field.  The successful candidate will be part of a
multidisciplinary team using functional neuroimaging to map brain activity and
neurochemical mechanisms associated with normal higher cognitive function as
well as dysfunction in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.  In
addition to collaborative work within the team, he or she will be expected to
carry out his or her own research.  Possible areas of concentration include 1)
neurofunctional substrate of higher cognitive function, particularly as regards
working memory and frontal lobe, 2) neurofunctional bases of neuropsychiatric
illnesses, especially schizophrenia, 3) computational neuroscience, including
statistical and systems approaches, and 4) neurochemical underpinnings of higher
cognitive function and dysfunction.  The goal of these fellowships is to provide
extensive experience in research design in neuroimaging, development of
cognitive activation tasks for use in functional neuroimaging, collection of
neuroimaging data, and image processing and analysis.  Familiarity with
computers (especially Unix and C/C++) and statistical methods such as SPM and an
interest in computational methods and cognitive neuroscience will confer an
advantage but are not absolute requirements.  Stipends are competitive and
depend on level of experience.  Send letter of interest outlining experience and
research goals, CV, two letters of recommendation, and (for Ph.D.'s) graduate
school transcript ASAP to: Karen F. Berman, M.D.; Chief, Unit on Integrative
Neuroimaging; National Institutes of Health; NIH Building 10, Rm 4C101; 9000
Rockville Pike; Bethesda MD 20892-1365 USA.  Phone: (301) 496-7603; FAX: (301)
496-7437.

The National Institute of Mental Health is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
