Subject: Faculty Positions at UCSD
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Recall my previous note about three positions at ucsd,
with most of them mentioning machine learning. We are 
moving quickly on senior candidates. If you're thinking
of applying, don't delay! (If you've already applied,
this does *not* mean we're unhappy with you! ;-))

See "joining our department" off the main web page,
www.cse.ucsd.edu, for details on applying.

One of the positions:

The Ronald R. Taylor Chair position in Information
Technology in Computer Science at the full professor
level. This chair is targeted towards applicants in
bioinformatics, computational biology, databases,
data-intensive computing, data mining, or information
technology.

cheers,
gary
