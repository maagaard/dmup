Postdoctoral position available in
behavioral/cognitive neuroscience

We use state-of the-art multi-electrode technology to record single-unit
activity from neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and related
structures of freely moving animals.  Current projects include studies
of the interactions between place cells in the hippocampus and head
direction cells of the thalamus, and the processing of information
through the different areas of the hippocampal formation (entorhinal
cortex, dentate gyrus, CA fields, and subiculum).  Expertise in
single-unit physiology, behavioral neuroscience, or computational
neuroscience is preferred.  Please send a CV, statement of research
interests, and references to:
