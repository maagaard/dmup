POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS
W.M. KECK MACHINE PSYCHOLOGY LABORATORY

The Neurosciences Institute, located in San Diego, California, invites
applications for POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS to study biologically based
models of behaving real world devices (robots) as part of the newly
established W.M. Keck Machine Psychology Laboratory.  Continuing
previous research conducted at the Institute, this Laboratory will be
focusing on the construction of autonomous robots, the design of
simulated models of large-scale neuronal networks that are capable of
guiding behavior in the real world, and on developing methods for the
simultaneous analysis of neural and behavioral states.  Applicants
should have a background in computational neuroscience, robotics,
computer science, behavioral or cognitive science.

Fellows will receive stipends appropriate to their qualifications and
experience.  Submit a curriculum vitae, statement of research
interests, and names of three referees to:
