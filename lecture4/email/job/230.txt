A 2 year post-doctoral position is available at the Beckman Institute 
at the University of Illinois. This position will involve working 
with Amnesia and Neglect patients and doing functional MRI in both 
patient populations and normal subjects. These projects will 
investigate plasticity of neural and cognitive function and intact 
cognitive processes in these patient populations.

Candidates with experience with patient populations, functional 
neuroimaging, and SPM analysis package are especially encouraged to 
apply. Please send (via email or mail) a vita and reference
