Research Positions at the European Media Laboratory

The Human Language Technology and the Personal Memory group at the
European Media Laboratory in Heidelberg are seeking several researchers
to work in the areas of  information retrieval,  information extraction,
domain ontology building, and human computer interfaces. 

1.   A researcher with experience in terminological  ontology building,
knowledge representation languages, reasoning,  lexical / knowledge
acquisition from corpora. The appointee will work in close collaboration
with the team of Bio-Informatics (molecular biology) of EML and the
Department of Information Science of Tokyo University. We require
someone who has a PhD in NLP or in CS with a  demonstrated ability to do
independent research. 
Preference will be given to applicants who can demonstrate practical
abilities in the building of domain ontologies and who have a strong NLP
background. 

2. A researcher  to work on natural language interfaces with excellent
knowledge in object-oriented software development (e.g., Java) and XML.
The appointee should have experience in GUI programming.
Experience in dialog modeling and discourse structure would be an
advantage.
The successful candidate will be responsible for designing and
implementing an interactive interface for information retrieval,
database integration and ontological integration. The candidate will
join an interdisciplinary team of computational linguists, computer
scientists and domain experts who will use the designed interface for
practical purposes.  

3. A researcher with strong interests in the area of NLP and in
particular in statistical NLP. The candidate should have excellent
programming skills. 
The candidate should be familiar with the theory and implementation of
finite-state automata, finite-state transducers and robust parsing
techniques. 
The candidate is expected to work on areas such as semantic information
retrieval, document classification, and clustering.

4. A Computer Scientist with strong background in one or more of the
following areas: adaptive user interfaces, dialog management for
human-computer interaction, context and situation modeling. We expect
the candidates to have significant experience in object-oriented
software development (e.g., Java), machine learning, and databases.
Successful candidates should have a PhD or professional experience the
field.
Successful candidates will join a multi-disciplinary group and will
participate in projects that aim at building user-oriented computer
systems such as mobile tourism information systems. These projects are
embedded into a network of collaborations with national and
international research partners from industry and academics. 

We offer competitive salaries, depending on professional experience and
scientific achievements. The positions are available for 3 years, with
the possibility of renewing the appointment depending on performance,
and availability of funding. 

EML is a newly established private research laboratory that primarily
does contract research for the Klaus Tschira Foundation. It engages in
research in the manifold uses of information technology, it's primary
interest being the development of new ways to increase the usefulness of
such technology for the individual and for society.  Scientists from
many different disciplines and countries work together at the EML, in
particular, there is a regular exchange between the EML and national and
international institutions. You will experience a challenging and
stimulating international work environment here. In addition, the EML is
located in one of the most beautiful old mansions of Heidelberg.

Should you be interested in working with us please send your application
including full CV and relevant material attesting your qualifications by
11th of June 1999 to our secretary, c/o Brbel Mack,
Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg 33, D-69118 Heidelberg, .
