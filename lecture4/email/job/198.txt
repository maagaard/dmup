Here's a job posting that may be of interest to the readers of this list.


The Microsoft Handwriting Recognition team has immediate
openings in handwriting recognition research and development.

Responsibilities center on incorporating research into the
Microsoft Handwriting Recognition (HR) engine. Experience
in handwriting recognition technology is not required, but
a solid background in Computer Science, Mathematics, or
Statistics, is needed, as is the desire and ability to
learn new techniques from textbooks or research papers.
The HR engine is being developed for English and Japanese
and includes components that implement neural nets, hidden
Markov models, signal processing, statistical search, n-gram
statistical language modeling, and context-free grammar
language modeling. Improvements to the HR engine are
targeted at increasing performance and accuracy, and
improving usability problems for mainstream use in
applications, such as note taking into future versions of
Microsoft Office. Qualifications required include at least
a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, Mathematics,
EE/Signal Processing, or related field, and strong C/C++
coding skills.  You must be able to code up your ideas to
improve the recognizer in C/C++.  A strong interest and
ability to write and support your own code in C/C++ is 
crucial to being successful in the group.

Send your resume, complete with references
(if that is practical), to:

Dr. James A. Pittman
jpittman@microsoft.com

I prefer email in either Word or ascii format,
but you can also snailmail to:

Dr. James A. Pittman, 30/3092
