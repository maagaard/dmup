Early-stage, VC funded startup at the intersection of data mining,
music cognition and the Web is seeking several top-notch developers.
Our technology for navigating through the space of music is based on
consumer perception, machine listening, and computational learning,
including neural networks and Bayes nets.  It will be deployed in
several commercial applications, enabling the consumer to explore and
access music using our novel search capabilities.

We are looking for exceptional talent with outstanding technical and
analytical abilities to join our interdisciplinary team in the area of
machine learning and statistical modeling (e.g., in Matlab or S-Plus).

Other jobs are in the areas:
- Coding (demonstrable strength in C, C++, JavaScript, Java, Perl);
- Database systems and programming (SQL, ODBC, JDBC).

Ideal candidates will have additional experience in areas such as
information retrieval, collaborative filtering, user interface design
and Web-based applications.

We are located in the Bay Area on a private estate that provides a
creative and inspiring setting with a very productive infrastructure.

If you are interested in working on this exciting technology, please
email your resume in plain text to soundwalk@stanfordalumni.org,
clearly indicating your specific experiences in your strongest area.

Thank you.

Andreas Weigend
