Dear Colleague,

Please bring the following information to the attention of potential
graduate school applicants from your program with an interest in Brain and
Cognitive Sciences.

GRADUATE PROGRAM IN BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
PSYCHOLOGY AT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY, CARBONDALE.

The Department of Psychology at Southern Illinois University has several
openings for fall 2000 admission to its newly established Ph.D. program in
Brain and Cognitive Sciences. The program emphasizes cognitive behavior
approached from a combination of developmental (infancy and childhood,
adolescence and aging), neurobiological (neurophysiology, neuropsychology,
genetics), behavioral (human and animal experimentation) and computational
(neural networks, statistical analyses) perspectives. As an integral part
of their training, students become active participants in ongoing faculty
research programs in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Students will
receive training in two or more different research methodologies, and are
expected to develop a multidisciplinary approach to their own research.

Current research by the Brain and Cognitive Sciences faculty includes
perinatal risk factors in child development, neurophysiological and
behavioral correlates of infant and child cognitive and language
development, personality and social correlates of cognitive aging, child
play and social behaviors, identity development across the life span,
neural network modeling of language acquisition and processing, artificial
grammar learning, sentence processing, evolution of language and the
brain, the pharmacological modulation of memory, effects of psychoactive
drugs, reversible inactivation of discrete brain areas and memory,
recovery of function from brain damage, electrophysiological models (e.g.,
long-term potentiation), the neurophysiology of memory, animal learning,
and human learning and memory.

For more information about the program and application procedures, please
visit our web site at:

Visit also the Department's web site at:

	http://www.siu.edu/~psycho

The deadline for applications is February 1st, 2000. Complete applications
received by January 15, 2000 may be considered for one of the prestigious
Morris Fellowships.

Best regards,

Morten Christiansen
Coordinator of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Program
