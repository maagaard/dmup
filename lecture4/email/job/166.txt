Research position
Service of Stochastic Methods
University of Li=E8ge - Belgium

Within the context of a collaboration with the Center for Research in
Metallurgy (CRM) in the field of Data Mining, the Service of Stochastic
Methods of the University of Li=E8ge (Belgium) offers a full time
research position.

Description of the research project
The term Data Mining denotes a set of techniques and activities aiming
at the extraction of synthetic information (knowledge) from low level
data stored in large databases. This project aims at applying these
techniques to the prediction of the thermal state of steel furnaces. Le
goal of the project is to develop a software tool able to predict
temperature within a time span of about one hour, and in particular to
predict as early as possible the development of thermal instabilities.
To this end, a database composed of various measurements obtained in
operation of a real steel furnace will be used. Data Mining, and in
particular neural networks will be applied to these data in order to
extract predictive models.

Profile
MS or PhD in computer or electrical engineering.
Strong interest for academic R&D.
Good abilities for team work and human relations.
Good abilities in modeling and abstraction.
Working English.
Interest for software development.

Practical information.
One year research contract (fixed duration) to start in October 1999.
Support of the researcher by the Service of Stochastic Methods in the
field of Data Mining methods and software.
