Senior Research Technologist
Sensory Inc.
Sunnyvale, CA
http://www.sensoryinc.com

Working under general supervision, this person will develop novel speech
encoding and recognition algorithms, and will adapt existing algorithms to
low-end platforms with memory and processor-speed constraints.

Primary Responsibilities/Duties

* Provides in-house corporate expertise for traditional methods of
  speech recognition.

* Working from general concepts, develops specifications and 
  models for speech processing and recognition algorithms.

* Develops testing and cross-validation protocols, methods, and tools
  for performance evaluation and improvement.

* Exercises experience and knowledge to optimize software performance
  consistent with constraints imposed by implementation on Sensory's custom ICs.

* Works with assembly-language programmers to assist in porting
  algorithms from C to chip implementation.

Position Requirements, Desired Experience and Skills:

* MS in computer science, engineering, applied statistics,
  computational linguistics, or cognitive science; Ph.D. preferred

* Strong academic, research, and/or development background in signal
  processing for speech and automatic speech recognition.

* Minimum of 2 years' experience with speech feature encoding and
  recognition algorithms (including HMMs, neural nets, vector quantization)

* Experience in DSP desirable. Knowledge of LPC a plus.

* Fluency in C

* State-of-the-art knowledge of machine learning and speech recognition
  techniques

* The candidate should enjoy discussing and debating complex technical
  issues.
