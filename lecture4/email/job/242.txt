Dear Colleagues,

I have a Research Studentship available here in London, UK, to work on
motion planning and control algorithms for robots involving research on
sensors and neural networks.
 
Applicants should hold a first class honours degree in mechanical
engineering, electronic engineering or a related subject. The
studentship is only open for candidates from the European Union (EU).

Further details can be obtained by writing or e-mailing to me. 

If you know of anyone interested please feel free to pass this
information on.

Best regards,

Kaspar Althoefer.
