We're currently advertising a position in machine learning at the
Australian National University.  It's a limited term (3-5 year) research
position at academic level B (Research Fellow).  Researchers in the
group (which currently includes Peter Bartlett, Jonathan Baxter, Markus
Hegland, John Lloyd and Stephen Roberts) work on a variety of
theoretical
and experimental areas in machine learning, including: reinforcement
learning, computational learning theory, neural networks, large margin
classification and prediction, scalable data analysis for data mining,
and logic for machine learning.

See http://wwwrsise.anu.edu.au/ad.html#LevB_CSL for more information.
