Subject: postdoc positions at University of Rochester
Status: RO
X-Status: 

POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER.  The Department of
Brain and Cognitive Sciences seeks two outstanding postdoctoral
fellows with research interests in learning and/or developmental
cognitive science.  One fellowship is affiliated with a NIH training
grant in Learning, Development, and Behavior, and the other fellowship
is affiliated with a NSF grant on Learning and Intelligent Systems.
Supervising faculty for both fellowships work on problems of learning
and development using behavioral, computational, and neurobiological
approaches.  Candidates should have prior background in at least one
of these approaches and an interest in working collaboratively in a
highly interdisciplinary setting.  Several faculty have special
interest in statistical learning in the domains of language and
perception, although a commitment to this interest is associated only
with the NSF fellowship.  The NIH fellowship is open only to US
citizens or permanent residents.  Applicants should send a letter
describing their graduate training and research interests, a
curriculum vitae, and arrange to have three letters of recommendation
sent to: Professor Richard N. Aslin, Department of Brain and Cognitive
Sciences, Meliora Hall, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY
14627-0268.  Review of applications will begin on February 15, 1999
and continue until one or both positions are filled, with an expected
start date of June/August, 1999.  Applicants can learn about the
department, its faculty, and the opportunities for training by
referring to our Web page (http://www.bcs.rochester.edu).
Applications from women and members of underrepresented minority
groups are especially welcome.  The University of Rochester is an
Equal Opportunity Employer.
