	Job opening in the Information Directorate at NASA Ames
	Research Center.


Description: This position provides an opportunity to participate in
research of Collective Intelligence (COIN), that is the analysis of
large, distributed artificial systems and implementation of local
strategies for augmenting their performance. In particular, this
position involves research into the implementation on networks of COIN
research involving machine learning.  Tasks will include:

-- Building and maintaining models for simulating the behavior of
networks, using the OPNET network simulator. Setting up and running
experiments on the application of COIN technology to the simulated
control of those networks. Create and investigate new COIN technology
in the domain of the OPNET simulations.

-- Writing programs and scripts to carry out data collection from
the network simulations. Analyzing the data and creating plots from
these experiments, using packages like Matlab or OPNET's built-in
analysis tool.

The research of the group is described at 
http://ic.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/index.html. 



Minimal Requirements:

-- B.A./B.S. in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or related field.

-- Extended knowledge of and experience with C and/or C++.

-- Basic knowledge of UNIX.

-- Interest in Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Statistics
	and/or network theory.


Preferred:

-- Masters Degree

-- Experience with the OPNET network simulator.

-- Experience with Perl or shell scripts.

-- Experience with Matlab.

-- Familiarity with reinforcement learning algorithms.

-- U.S. citizen or permanent resident.




Please direct responses, including a resume, to David Wolpert,
Automated Learning Group NASA Ames Research Center MS 269-1, Moffett
Field, CA 94035, USA dhw@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov.

Salary will be commensurate with experience. NASA/Ames is an equal
oppurtunity employer.
