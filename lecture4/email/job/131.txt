A research associate is required to assist in the running of a BBSRC funded
project titled 'The role of VISUAL SYNCHRONY in perceptual organisation:
studies in human psychophysics and computational methods.' The research
programme follows-up studies described in a recent paper  
(Usher & Donnelly, 1998, Nature, pp. 179-182) investigating spatio-temporal 
interactions in visual grouping as a means for exploring mechanisms for 
GROUPING based on neural synchrony. The award was made to Dr Nick Donnelly 
(University of Southampton) and to Dr Marius Usher (Birkbeck College,
University of London).

The project will run for twelve months in the first instance (and will be
performed either in London or in Southampton). It is intended that further
funds will be sought during this first year to continue the research. The
ideal candidate will have a background in visual psychophysics and should
have experience programming in C on Unix workstations (experience with
Silicon Graphics graphical libraries and/or OpenGL will be helpful).  The
salary will be based on the research associate scale and will be up to
BP 16,927 (i.e., approx. $27,920) per annum.
For further information contact either Nick Donnelly (email:
n.donnelly@ukc.ac.uk) or Marius Usher (email: m.usher@ukc.ac.uk

Deadline for applications: July 1st 1999.
 
Marius Usher
Lecturer in Psychology
and Cognitive Neuroscience
