Subject: PhD position available

X-Status: 

PhD position for neural network research at SNN, University of 
Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

Background:
The SNN neural networks research group at the university of Nijmegen 
consists of 10 researchers and PhD students and conducts
theoretical and applied research on neural networks and graphical
models. The group is part
of the Laboratory of Biophysics which is involved in experimental brain
science.

Recent research of the group has focussed on theoretical description of
learning processes using the theory of stochastic processes and the design
of efficient learning rules for Boltzmann machines using techniques from
statistical mechanics; the extraction of rules from data and the
integration of knowledge and data for modeling; the design of robust
methods for confidence estimation with neural networks; applications in
medical diagnosis and prediction of consumer behaviour. 

Research project:
The modern view on AI, neural networks as well as parts of statistics, is to
describe learning and reasoning using a probabilistic framework. A particular
advantage of the probabilistic framework is that domain knowledge in the form
of rules and data can be easily combined in model construction. The main
drawback is that inference and learning in large probabilistic networks 
is intractible.
Therefore, robust approximation schemes are needed to apply this technology to
large real world applications. 
The topic of research is to develop learning rules for neural networks
and graphical models using techniques from statistical mechanics.

Requirements:
The candidate should have a strong background in theoretical physics or
mathematics.

The PhD position:
Appointment will be full-time for four years. Gross salary will be NLG 2184 
per month in the first year, increasing to NLG 3899 in the fourth year. 

More information:
Details about the research can be found at
http://www.mbfys.kun.nl/SNN or by contacting dr. H.J.
Kappen (bert@mbfys.kun.nl, ++31243614241). 

Applications should include a curriculum vitae and a
statement of the candidate's professional interests and goals, and one
copy of recent work (e.g., thesis, article). Interested applicants
should express their interest by email to bert@mbfys.kun.nl before 
October 17. Full applications 
should be sent before October 25 to the
Personnel Department of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of
Nijmegen, Toernooiveld 1, 6525 ED Nijmegen, vacancy number 98-52.
