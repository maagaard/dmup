POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN NEURONAL MODELING/NONLINEAR DYNAMICS

The Physics Department of the University of Ottawa
has an immediate opening for a postdoctoral position 
in Neuronal Modeling and Nonlinear Dynamics. The 
research will focus mainly on the role of feedback 
in sensory systems, with an emphasis on electrosensory 
systems. The position is for one year, renewable one year. 
Applications will be accepted until the position is filled. 
Candidates must be within the first four years of their doctoral
degree.  

Candidates must have demonstrated excellence in research,  
and possess a strong background in neuronal modeling and  
nonlinear dynamics; those whose training is more slanted 
towards either of these areas will also be considered. 
Candidates wishing to carry out a blend of experimental 
work and modeling/computational studies are strongly 
encouraged to apply; experiments would be carried out 
in Prof. Len Maler's laboratory in the Faculty of Medicine 
at the University of Ottawa. The salary of $31,000 CAN 
per year conforms with current NSERC guidelines; 
additional support for moving and conference travel 
is also available. A second similar postdoctoral position 
will become available with a starting date around January 2001. 

The National Capital Region of Canada, with a population around 
one million, is the home of the Federal Government, the National 
Research Council, and many other governmental research laboratories. 
Also known as Silicon Valley North, the region has a very 
high concentration of high-tech companies. Its National Art 
Center, Rideau Canal, museums, cafes, numerous cultural festivals, 
and its close proximity to hiking, swimming, canoeing and skiing 
areas make Ottawa a most enjoyable place to live in. 
 
Applicants should send a CV and a brief statement 
of research interests by regular mail or email 
(postdoc99@miro.physics.uottawa.ca), and arrange 
for a minimum of two letters of recommendation to 
be sent to:

Prof. Andre Longtin
