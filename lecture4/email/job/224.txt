Research Position (BAT IIa) available 
(cognitive/computational neuroscience and brain imaging)

At the University of Ulm an interdiscplinary research project on 
analysis and modeling of functional magnetic resonance data has been 
established. It is a joint project of the departments of Psychiatry
(Prof. Dr. M. Spitzer), Radiology and Neural Information Processing
(Prof. Dr. G. Palm). The project focusses on the development of new 
methods for the detection and interpretation of functional/effective 
connectivity in fMRI data and their application to working memory tasks. 
This project offers a unique environment for a direct cooperation between 
theorists and experimenters. 

In the described project a position is available (beginning Jan 2000, 
2 years, 1 year extension possible). 
Candidates should be strongly interested in interdisciplinary research.
They should have a background in statistical methods (cluster analysis,
Neural Networks), functional MRI analysis or computational neuroscience. 
Required is a recent masters degree or equivalent in computer science, 
physics, mathematics or in a closely related area. Experience in programming 
in C in a Unix environment is necessary, experience with MATLAB and SPM 
is helpful. The research can be conducted as part of a PhD thesis degree 
in Computer Science. 

Salary according to BAT IIa. The University of Ulm is an equal opportunity 
employer and encourages female scientists to apply. Employment 
will be effected through the "Zentrale Universitaetsverwaltung" of the 
University of Ulm.

Ulm is a town of about 160000 inhabitants nicely situated in 
the Danube valley. It has picturesque old parts (not to forget the
gothic cathedral with the highest church tower of the world) 
and is surrounded by beautiful landscape, lakes, creek valleys, 
forrests and the sparsely populated "Schwaebische Alb" high plane. 
In an one hour train ride one can either reach the alps for skiing 
and hiking, or the cities of Munich and Stuttgart for more 
sophisticated cultural programs. 


Please send us CV, letter of motivation, and, if possible, addresses of 
three referees.
