POSTDOCTORAL TRAINING FELLOWSHIPS in the
COGNITIVE SCIENCE PROGRAM at INDIANA UNIVERSITY in
MODELING OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES

The Psychology Department and Cognitive Science Program
at Indiana University anticipate one or more
Postdoctoral Traineeships in the area of Modeling of
Cognitive Processes, funded by the National Institutes
of Health. Appointments will pay rates appropriate for
a new or recent Ph.D. and will be for one or two years,
beginning July 1, 2000 or later.

Traineeships will be offered to qualified individuals
who wish to further their training in mathematical
modeling or computer simulation modeling, in any
substantive area of cognitive psychology or Cognitive
Science.

Trainees will be expected to carry out original
theoretical and empirical research in association with
one or more of these faculty and their laboratories,
and to interact with other relevant faculty and other
pre- and postdoctoral trainees. In addition, they
should plan to take or audit courses offered within the
Cognitive Modeling Program.

We are particularly interested in applicants with
strong mathematical, scientific, and research
credentials. Indiana University has superb
computational and research facilities, and faculty with
outstanding credentials in this area of research,
including James Townsend, director of the training
program, and Jerome Busemeyer, Robert Nosofsky, John
Kruschke, Michael Gasser, Robert Goldstone, Geoffrey
Bingham, Tom Busey, Donald Robinson, Robert Port, and
Richard Shiffrin.

Applicants should send an up-to-date vita, relevant
reprints and preprints, a personal letter describing
their research interests, background, goals, and career
plans, and reference letters from two individuals.
Women, minority group members, and handicapped
individuals are urged to apply.

Deadline for submission of application materials is
April 1, 2000, but we encourage earlier applications.

PLEASE NOTE: The conditions of our grant restrict all
awards to U.S. citizens or current green card holders.
Awards also have a 'payback' provision, generally
requiring awardees to carry out research or teach (not
necessarily at IU) for a minimum period after
termination of the traineeship.
