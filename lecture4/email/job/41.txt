THE NEUROSCIENCES INSTITUTE, SAN DIEGO

The Neurosciences Institute is an independent, not-for-profit organization
at the forefront of research on the brain. Research at the Institute spans
levels from the molecular to the behavioral and from the computational to
the cognitive. The Institute has a strong tradition in theoretical
neurobiology and has recently established new experimental facilities. The
Institute is also the home of the Neurosciences Research Program and serves
as an international meeting place for neuroscientists.

JUNIOR FELLOW, NEURAL BASIS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. The Institute has a strong
tradition in the theoretical and experimental study of consciousness (see
Science, 282:1846-1851). Applications are invited for positions as Junior
Fellows to collaborate on experimental and theoretical studies of the neural
correlates of conscious perception. Applicants should be at the Postdoctoral
level with strong backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging
(including MEG, EEG, and fMRI), and theoretical neurobiology.
JUNIOR FELLOW IN THEORETICAL NEUROBIOLOGY. Applications are invited for
positions as Junior Fellows in Theoretical Neurobiology. Since 1987, the
Institute has had a research program dedicated to developing biologically
based, experimentally testable theoretical models of neural systems. Current
projects include large-scale simulations of neuronal networks and the
analysis of functional interactions among brain areas using
information-theoretical approaches. Advanced computing facilities are
available. Applicants should be at the Postdoctoral level with strong
backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, and computer modeling.
JUNIOR FELLOW IN EXPERIMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY. Applications are invited for
positions as Junior Fellow in Experimental Neurobiology. A current focus of
the Institute is on the action and pharmacological manipulation of
neuromodulatory systems with diffuse projections, such as the noradrenergic,
serotoninergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic systems.
Another focus is on behavioral state control and the functions of sleep.
Applicants should be at the Postdoctoral level with strong backgrounds in
the above-mentioned areas.

Fellows receive stipends and research support commensurate with
qualifications and experience. Positions are now available. Applications for
all positions listed should contain a short statement of research interests,
a curriculum vitae, and the names of three references and should be sent to:
Giulio Tononi, The Neurosciences Institute, 10640 John Jay Hopkins Drive,
