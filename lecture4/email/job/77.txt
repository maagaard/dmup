CASE PhD Studentship in Computer Science and Chemistry.
University of York, York, UK.
Supported by the BBSRC and Glaxo-Wellcome Ltd.

Chemical structure matching using neural networks.

Applicants are urgently requested to apply for a three year BBSRC PhD
studentship supported by Glaxo-Wellcome under the industrial CASE
scheme. The project will investigate the use of neural network based
search systems for chemical structure matching in large chemical
databases. The focus of the studentship will be in identifying the
benefits of the methods in chemistry, and in the optimisation of the
methods for small molecule and protein structure matching in very
large molecular database systems.

The project will be undertaken in the Departments of Chemistry
(Protein Chemistry Group) and Computer Science (Neural Networks
Research group) at the University of York and at the Glaxo-Wellcome
research centre in Peterborough within the Computational Chemistry
Group. All groups are internationally known for their work in neural
networks or computational chemistry.

The work will build on collaborative research over the last three
years between the three groups, details of which can be found in our
web page
(http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/arch/neural/research/adam/molecules).

Candidates will have a first degree in chemistry and will have
programming ability (preferably in C++, under UNIX). Additional
experience in Computer Science and neural networks would be an
advantage but is not essential.

The post must be filled on the 1st April 1999, thus candidates must be
available to take up the post at that date. The deadline for
applications is 15th March 1999 with interviews to be held as soon as
possible after that date.

Applications can be made by email, fax or by post. Informal enquiries
can be made to Prof. Jim Austin at the address below.
