Subject: Academic Positions in Computational Neuroscience
Status: RO
X-Status: 

The University of Plymouth is considering the possibility of making some senior
academic appointments, ie Professor, Reader or Senior Lecturer, in the area
of Computational Neuroscience, with the aim of further strengthening this
research area. 

The possible appointments are also linked to a proposal to create a
multidisciplinary Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, involving links
between experimental neuroscientists at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory,
neurologists at the Postgraduate Medical School, and cognitive scientists
and neuropsychologists (including two new Professorship appointments) in
the Faculty of Human Sciences.

We would like to hear, informally at present, from anyone who might have an
interest in such an appointment, without obligation to either party. If you
were able to email a curriculum vitae, setting out in particular your
research achievements in this area, we would be very grateful. We would
also be happy to respond to any enquiries. All expressions of interest and
enquiries will be treated as confidential.

Please respond by email to: Professor Mike Denham <mike@soc.plym.ac.uk>
