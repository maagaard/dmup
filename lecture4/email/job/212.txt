BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES--THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT SOUTHERN
ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY, CARBONDALE invites applications for two positions at
the Assistant or Associate Professor level from individuals with research
and teaching interests in human cognition. The two positions are intended
to support and strengthen our newly-organized graduate program in Brain
and Cognitive Sciences. (See http://www.siu.edu/~psycho/bcs for a program

will be expected to share responsibility for teaching basic graduate and
undergraduate courses in memory and cognition, possibly undergraduate
research methods, as well as courses in their own specialty area. 2)
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD: Candidates for this
position will be expected to share responsibility for teaching basic
graduate and undergraduate courses in pre-adolescent development, possibly
undergraduate research methods, as well as courses within their own
specialty area. The Developmental position is a security-sensitive
position. Before an offer of employment is made, the University will
conduct a pre-employment background investigation that includes a criminal
background check.  For both positions, we are especially interested in
candidates with expertise in computational modeling (preferably neural
networks) and/or cognitive neuroscience. Interest and experience with an
integrated multidisciplinary approach to research area is highly
desirable. 

Applicants must have either demonstrated potential for (Assistant
Professor level) or an established record of (Associate Professor level)
excellence in teaching, publication, and externally-funded research. The
appointment will be made at the Assistant or Associate level to begin
August 16, 2000. Ph.D. in Psychology required. ABD applicants will be
considered at an Assistant Professor appointment if all degree
requirements will be met by August 16, 2000. If all requirements for the
Ph.D. are not completed by that date, a one-year term appointment will be
offered at the rank of instructor. Review of applications will begin
December 1, 1999, but applications will be accepted until the position is
filled. Applicants should send a cover letter with an explicit statement
of research interests, a current curriculum vitae, relevant
reprints/preprints, teaching evaluations (if available), and have three
letters of recommendation sent to: 

Stephanie Clancy Dollinger, Ph.D.,
