A Research Assistant position will be available soon
in Computer Science, The Queen's University of Belfast,
in the area of visualization of user behavior in information
spaces.  Please let Fionn Murtagh (address below) know
of your interest in this position.  A short description
of the work to be undertaken follows.

The European (5th Framework) project "IRAIA - Getting
Orientation in Complex Information Spaces as an Emergent
Behavior of Autonomous Information Agents", which will
last for two years, will be starting in March 2000.

"Information retrieval systems of the future will be
huge information repositories, distributed all over the
world.  Even the users will contribute to these
repositories by communicating their experiences to other
users who follow their footsteps.  IRAIA's design
metaphor focuses on the ants' system for communicating
information.  Navigating the web should allow people to
leave pointers for those who might also navigate along
the same paths."

QUB work in this project will include the development of
an architecture of different layers of abstraction that
support the construction of a coordinate system based on
ontologies and investigation of user behavior.  Such
user profiling will be based on information visualizations
such as Kohonen self-organizing feature maps or similar
active maps based on linkage graphs.  These will be
interfaced to the agent (CORBA, EJB) environment used.
In more open research, the fact that map visualizations
are used means that we will also seek to relate and
exploit intriguing technologies used in digital image
transmission - thinwire transmission technologies, and
foveation-based strategies, based on multiscale transforms.
