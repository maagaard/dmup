Research in Intelligent Data Analysis and Fusion

A position is available for a Research Fellow to work in collaboration
with SmithKline Beecham, Glaxo-Wellcome, Unilever and Zeneca on an
EPSRC funded project selected by the NPL-Sira Faraday Partnership. The
aim of the project is to develop a hybrid data mining, analysis and
fusion system incorporating the most recent artificial intelligence,
neural network, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm techniques.

The research fellow will be responsible for development of a hybrid
system tool, for day to day running of the project, for evaluating the
performance of the system in collaboration with the above companies
and NPL, and for overseeing technology transfer to Integral Systems
Solutions Ltd, supplier of the Clementine data mining
system. Applicants should have a strong background in artificial
intelligence, computer science and the development of data mining
systems.

The Fellow will work in the Intelligent Systems Research Group with
four research students on the project, one associated with each of the
major collaborating companies. The Group has extensive experience in
the development of hybrid intelligent systems, in particular for
financial and commercial applications.

Applicants must have good mathematical and computing skills with
experience of data mining research or applications or have carried out
research and development in a closely related area.

The position is for up to three years. The Research Fellow will be on
the University RA1A scale (17,869-21,331 pounds sterling, including London
allowance, depending on experience and length of appointment).
