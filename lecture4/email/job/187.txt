DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA

Two positions in Computational Psychology / Computational Neuroscience or
in Cognitive Engineering

The Department of Psychology at the University of Alberta, is seeking to
expand its program in Computational Psychology and Cognitive Engineering.
Two tenure-track positions at the Assistant Professor level in
Computational Psychology / Computational Neuroscience or in Cognitive
Engineering will be open to competition. Appointments will be effective
July 1, 2000.

Candidates in Computational Psychology / Computational Neuroscience should
have a strong interest in modeling and predicting human behavior, or in
modeling of brain functions at the level of neurons, neuronal groups or
large brain subsystems using formal approaches such as mathematical
modeling, neural networks, evolutionary computing, or computer simulations.
Candidates in Cognitive Engineering should have a strong interest in
interaction of humans with computers, machines or complex environments, in
decision-support systems in industrial, medical or emergency situations,
and in the design of computer-based tools to support and enhance
performance of humans in
these situations.

The expectation is that the successful candidates will secure competitive
research funds and/or industrial support. Hiring decisions will be made on
the basis of demonstrated research capability, teaching ability, potential
for interactions with colleagues and fit with departmental needs. 

The applicant should send a curriculum vitae, a statement of current and
future research plans, recent publications, and arrange to have at least
three letters of reference forwarded, to: Dr Terry Caelli, Chair,
Department of Psychology P220 Biological Sciences Building University of
Alberta Edmonton, Alberta Canada T6G 2E9. Closing date for applications is
December 1, 1999.

Further information on these positions can be obtained from
http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/hiring.

In accordance with Canadian Immigration requirements, this advertisement is
directed to Canadian Citizens and permanent residents. If suitable Canadian
citizens and permanent residents cannot be found, other individuals will be
considered. The University of Alberta is committed to the principle of
equity in employment. As an employer we welcome diversity in the workplace
and encourage applications from all qualified women and men, including
Aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities, and members of visible
minorities.

Background


Computational Psychology / Computational Neuroscience 

Computational Psychology is concerned with the generation of formal
representations and algorithms for modeling, predicting and improving human
behavior. Computational Neuroscience, on the other hand, is concerned with
modeling brain functions different levels, at the level of single neurons,
at the level of neuronal groups, and at the level of brain subsystems.
Both, Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, rely on a wealth of
formal approaches: mathematical modeling, neural networks, evolutionary
computing, computer simulations, uncertainty calculi, HMMs, etc. A hiring
in this area not only strengthens the expertise in our program, but also
helps to
increase collaborative ties between programs (in particular with BCN) and
between departments (in particular with Neuroscience and with Computing
Science). 

Cognitive Engineering is concerned with the interaction of humans with
complex environments, such as the interaction of humans with computers,
machines or complex (typically industrial) environments, with
decision-support systems in industrial, medical or emergency situations,
with the design of computer-based tools to support and enhance performance
of humans in these situations, and with methods to efficiently train humans
for these situations. Cognitive Engineering relies on a variety of methods
and tools, including performance
assessment, spatial information systems and methods for developing computer
support technologies (e.g. expert systems, uncertainty, machine learning).
Cognitive Engineering has close links to Human Factors and industrial
applications.
