Oxford University Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of
the Brain

GlaxoWellcome Post Doc in Statistics and Image Analysis - Oxford
University


RS1A: £15,735-£23,651 

Start date: September/October 1999 

Closing date for applications: June 18th 1999 


The Oxford University Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
of the Brain (FMRIB) has recently been awarded funding by GlaxoWellcome
for a statistics / image analysis postdoctoral position (two-years in
the first instance). The proposed area of research would fit within the
current range of interests for FMRI and MRI analysis, which include:
FMRI statistics (time series filtering and analysis, statistical map
interpretation, cluster statistics, etc.); 3D image reconstruction from
original FT-like data sets; 3D registration; intensity bias field
correction; segmentation; 3D cortical flattening. 

The ideal applicant would have relevant experience with statistics /
time series analysis / image analysis research, probably with a doctoral
degree or equivalent. She/he would be supervised by Dr. Stephen Smith,
Head, Image Analysis Section. Queries relating to the post should be
directed to Dr Smith by e-mail at steve@fmrib.ox.ac.uk 

CVs should be sent to Dr Smith by post (Oxford Centre for Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, John Radcliffe Hospital,
Headington, Oxford, OX3 9DU) or email (steve@fmrib.ox.ac.uk), along with
names of two referees.
