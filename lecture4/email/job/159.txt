                   OREGON GRADUATE INSTITUTE 

The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (OGI) has an
immediate opening for an outstanding student in its Electrical and
Computer Engineering Ph.D program. Full stipend and tuition will be
covered.

The student will specifically work with Professor Eric A. Wan
(http://www.ece.ogi.edu/~ericwan/) on a number of projects relating to
neural network learning and speech enhancement.

QUALIFICATIONS: The candidate should have a strong background in
signal processing with some prior knowledge of neural networks.  A
Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering is preferred.

Please send inquiries and background information to
ericwan@ece.ogi.edu.


Eric A. Wan
Associate Professor, OGI


*********************************************************************

                            OGI

OGI is a young, but rapidly growing, private research institute
located in the Portland area. OGI offers Masters and PhD programs in
Computer Science and Engineering, Applied Physics, Electrical
Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Materials Science and Engineering,
and Environmental Science and Engineering.

OGI has world renowned research programs in the areas of speech
systems (Center for Spoken Language Understanding) and machine
learning.  (Center for Information Technologies).

Center for Spoken Language Understanding

The Center for Spoken Language Understanding is a multidisciplinary
academic organization that focuses on basic research in spoken
language systems technologies, training of new investigators, and
development of tools and resources for free distribution to the
research and education community. Areas of specific interest include
speech recognition, natural language understanding, text-to-speech
synthesis, speech enhancement in noisy conditions, and modeling of
human dialogue. A key activity is the ongoing development of the CSLU
Toolkit, a comprehensive software platform for learning about,
researching, and developing spoken dialog systems and new
applications.

Center for Information Technologies

The Center for Information Technologies supports development of
powerful, robust, and reliable information processing techniques by
incorporating human strategies and constraints. Such techniques are
critical building blocks of multimodal communication systems, decision
support systems, and human-machine interfaces. The CIT approach is
based on emulating relevant human information processing capabilities
and extending them to a variety of complex tasks. The approach
requires expertise in nonlinear and adaptive signal processing (e.g.,
neural networks), statistical computation, decision analysis, and
modeling of human information processing.  Correspondingly, CIT
research areas include perceptual characterization of speech and
images, prediction, robust signal processing, rapid adaptation to
changing environments, nonlinear signal representation, integration of
information from several sources, and integration of prior knowledge
with adaptation.
