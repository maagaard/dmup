Rutgers RUMBA (Rutgers Mind/Brain Analysis) Center and Rutgers DLDL
(Distributed Laboratories for Digital Libraries) has an immediate
opening for a Postdoctural Researcher in
area of Functional Brain Imaging and Neural Computation--see ad below:

RUTGERS UNVERSITY (RDLDL & RUMBA) seeking a post-doctoral researcher
with experience in brain imaging and computation (neural networks
etc..), to work on problems related to brain function and information
finding tasks.  The underlying questions are (1) does the brain of a
person doing fundamental tasks such as scanning for a given image, for a
given term, or for terms or images related to a given concept, exhibit
patterns of activation that distinguish these states from other states
associated with other types of information processing (2) if such states
and patterns of activation exist, can knowledge of them be used to
improve our understanding of the cognitive aspects of information
finding, and ultimately, to improve the systems used to perform those
tasks.

The successful candidate will work closely with Profs. Martin-Bly,
Hanson and Kantor in the UMDNJ-Rutgers (RUMBA) functional imaging
laboratories.  The starting time for the position
is in January 1999.

Rutgers University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
Qualified women and minority candidates are especially encouraged to
apply. Send CV and three letters of recommendation and 2 reprints to
Professor B. Martin Bly, Department of PsychologyRDLDL/RUMBA SEARCH,
Rutgers University, Newark, NJ 07102.   Also see:

Preferably send material through email:  Please send email with subject
header--RDLDL or RUMBA with application material to
ben@psychology.rutgers.edu or jose@psychology.rutgers.edu.
