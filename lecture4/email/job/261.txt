We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow with research interests in computational
neuroscience and cognitive science to collaborate in a project aiming at
identifying the neural correlates of sensorimotor categorization. Candidates
should have expertise in computational modeling, in human or animal research
on learning and some experience in applying neural models to artificial
systems (robots or simulations).  

The fellowship, for a 2-years period, include salary, accomodation and
airfare. Candidates should contact Luc Berthouze for more details.
