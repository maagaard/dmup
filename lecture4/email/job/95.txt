****************************************************

1) COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE POST-DOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE

	A post-doctoral position is available immediately for
computational modeling of dendritic morphology, neuronal connectivity, and
development of anatomically and physiologically accurate neural networks. 
All highly motivated candidates with a recent PhD in biology, computer
science, physics, or other areas related to Neuroscience (including MD or
engineering degree) are encouraged to apply. C programming skills and/or
experience with GENESIS or other modeling packages are desirable but not
necessary. 
	Post-doc will join a young and dynamic research group at the
Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, located in Fairfax, VA (<20 miles
west of Washington DC). The initial research project is focused on (1) the
generation of complete neurons in virtual reality that reproduce
accurately the experimental morphological data; and (2) the study of the
influence of dendritic shape (geometry and topology) on the
electrophysiological behavior. We have developed advanced software to
build network models of entire regions of the brain (e.g. the rat
hippocampus), and the successful candidate will also work on this aspect
of the research. 
	The post-doc will be hired as a Research Assistant Professor (with
VA state employee benefits) with a salary based on the NIH postdoctoral
scale, and will have a private office, a new computer, and full-time
access on Silicon Graphics server and consoles.
	Send CV, (p)reprints, a brief description of your motivation, and
names, email addresses and phone/fax numbers of references to: 
ascoli@gmu.edu (or by fax at the number below) ASAP. There is no deadline
but the position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found. 
        Non-resident aliens are also welcome to apply. The Krasnow
Institute is an equal opportunity employer.

2) PROGRAMMER POSITION AVAILABLE FOR NEUROSCIENCE PROJECT

A position for a junior scientific programmer is available immediately to
work in a research project aimed to the virtual construction of portions
of the brain. Candidates must have strong C (C++ a plus) programming
skills and software development experience in both Windows and Unix
environments. No background in neuroscience is requested, but interest and
motivation are highly desirable. All undergraduate/graduate students as
well as BA's, BS's, and MS's are encouraged to apply. The position can be
either part-time or full-time, and the schedule is extremely flexible.
	The programmer will join a young and dynamic research group at the
Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, located in Fairfax, VA (<20 miles
west of Washington DC). The successful candidate will work with the
principal investigator (Dr. Ascoli) on the implementation of algorithms to
generate neuronal structures in 3D according to known and novel anatomical
rules. In addition, routines will be developed to measure geometrical and
topological parameters from the tree-like branching structures. All the
executables (and some of the codes at the discretion of the principal
investigator) will be publicly distributed, and the programmer will be
given full intellectual credit in both software distribution and
scientific publications.
	The programmer will be hired as a Research Instructor (with
VA state employee benefits) with a salary proportioned to experience and
skills, and will have a new PC and full-time access on Silicon Graphics
server and O2 consoles.
	Send CV, a brief description of your motivation, and
names, email addresses and phone/fax numbers of references to: 
ascoli@gmu.edu (or by fax at the number below) ASAP. There is no deadline
but the position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found. 
        Non-resident aliens are also welcome to apply. The Krasnow
Institute is an equal opportunity employer.
