Sorry if you receive multiple copies of this announcements.
-----------------------------------------------------------

A Postdoctoral Research Associate and one PhD student are sought for an
exciting project aimed at developing principles of "Instruction-Based
Learning", i.e. teaching robots using natural language.

This project explores a still-untapped method of knowledge acquisition
and learning by intelligent systems: the acquisition of knowledge from
Natural Language (NL) instruction. This is very effective in human
learning and will be essential for adapting future intelligent systems to
the needs of naive users. The aim of the project is to investigate real
world Instruction Based-Learning (IBL) in a generic route instruction
task. Users will engage in a dialogue with a mobile robot equipped with
artificial vision, in order to teach it how to navigate a simplified
maze-like environment. This experimental set-up will limit perceptual
and control problems and also reduce the complexity of NL processing. The
research will focus on the problem of how NL instructions can be used by 
an intelligent embodied agent to build a hierarchy of complex functions
based on a limited set of low-level perceptual, motor and cognitive
functions. We will investigate how the internal representations required 
for robot sensing and navigation can support a usable speech-based 
interface. Given the use of artificial vision and voice input, such a
system can contribute to assisting visually impaired people and wheelchair 
users.

This 3 year project for 2 research associates and one PhD student is
funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. It
is jointly managed by Dr. G. Bugmann of the Centre for Neural and Adaptive
Systems of the University of Plymouth and by Dr. E. Klein of the
Institute for Communicating and Collaborative Systems at the University of
Edinburgh. The tasks are subdivided into two broad categories: (i)
natural language processing and dialogue management at Edinburgh (1 RA)
and (ii) robot experiments, knowledge representation and systems
integration in Plymouth (1 RA, 1 RS).  The project will involve sustained
interaction and coordination between the two groups in order to support
the required level of integration.

The positions offered in Plymouth are:

1. Research Associate
This position requires a strong background in the areas of systems
architecture, knowledge representation, systems integration, robotics
and artificial vision.  Salary scale: 15205-19999 UK Pounds (Pay award
pending.)

2. Research student
The PhD student will examine some of the more speculative and open-ended
aspects of IBL as a form of robot learning. Bursary: 6805 UK Pounds
(funding for non-UK students submitted to restrictions).

The two positions require skills in programming C++ and Perl/Python
under Windows NT or LINUX. Experience with hardware issues and real
world image processing is desirable.

Applications should be received before 1 December, but the positions
will remain open until suitable candidates are found.

Candidates should send a CV, a description of motivations and the names
of three references (by surface mail of email) to:
