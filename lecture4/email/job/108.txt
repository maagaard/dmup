Computational fMRI, graphics algorithms, and image processing.

Full time position in Brain and Vision Research Laboratory, Boston University

This  exciting new venture in the Brain and Vision Research Laboratory at
Boston University, Department of Biomedical Engineering involves
visualisation the working (plasticity and restorative plasticity) of the
human brain  during sensory-motor tasks.

Specifically, the postholder will:


   *  explore the uses of real-time and near-real-time analysis
>techniques in fMRI studies by applying several existing data abalysis
>packages for fMRI.

* model the  changes of functional connectivity of brain activations
using  structural equations models and functional connectivity models.

   * develop and implement  motion correction algorithms, elastic matching
algorithms.

Candidates should  have at least an MS in Electrical Engineering, Computer
Science, Physics or Mathematics. Good communication and interpersonal
skills, excellent background in C programming and should be familiar with
the Unix environment.  Good knowledge of college level mathematics (linear
algebra,partial differential equatuions, statistics and probability),signal
processing. Knowledge of computer graphics algorithms is a plus.
Familiarity with Sun, or SGI platforms and PC
is very desirable.

Please send a letter of application along with CV, publication list if
available, brief  statement of current research and background, and two
letters of recommendation  to
