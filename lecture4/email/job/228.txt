2 Postdoctoral positions are available in either computational
neuroscience or functional brain imaging.  Our research focuses
on the integration of computational models with functional
brain imaging, primarily fMRI.  We are particularly interested
in the application of nonlinear dynamical systems models to
fMRI datasets.  As a complementary approach, we also use
perturbation theory to design cognitive tasks appopriate for
the study of subconscious information processing in the brain.

Resources include ample computational platforms and access to
both a Philips 1.5 T scanner and a Varian 3 T to be installed
in summer 2000.
