Hi folks -

This is a "heads up" that the CSE Department at UCSD has
several faculty positions at Junior AND Senior levels that
we are going to try to fill this coming year. While the ad
specifies many areas, among the ones listed are machine
learning, data mining, bioinformatics, and computational
biology. The goal is to hire the best candidates, regardless
of area. If you are one of those, please apply!

See the web page:
http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/cse/Academic.Jobs.html

The deadline is January 15, 2000.

The CSE Department at UCSD is consistently ranked among the
top 20 in the US, and has made several key hires in recent
years in theory, networking, distributed systems. UCSD has
been ranked the number 1 public science university in the US
using only objective measures. There is a broad group of
people around the university interested in various standard
combinations of the words Neural, Computation, Cognition,
and Science.

Plus, we have the best weather - the beach party last year
was on Halloween!

cheers,
gary
