              Post-doctoral Research Positions
          METALEARNING, NEUROMODULATION AND EMOTION
                 http://meta.rad.atr.co.jp/
        CREST, Japan Science and Technology Corporation

The goal of the research project is to understand the mechanisms of
higher-level regulation of learning functions of the brain. We propose
computational models of the roles of the neuromodulators (e.g.,
dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, acetylecholine), test them by
neurobiological and clinical experiments, and explore the functions of
emotion-like systems in adaptive communication agents.

Post-doctoral research positions are available immediately for the studies
of 1) modeling the functions of neuromodulators in close collaboration
with the experimental laboratories below; 2) development of
self regulated learning algorithms for adaptive agents; and 3) designing
and building a colony of robots with rich sensory and motor functions.

Candidates should have a strong background in theoretical and/or
experimental sciences, including neurobiology, psychology, computer
science, robotics, physics and mathematics. 

Competitive salaries and benefits are provided by JST (Japan Science and
Technology Corporation). The laboratory is located at ATR International 
in Kyoto, where people from diverse origins and backgrounds get together
for basic research on human cognition and telecommunication.

The research project is supported by JST's "Creating the Brain" program,
supervised by Dr. Shun-ichi Amari. The principal project members and their
research topics are the following:

Takashi Matsumoto (Waseda University): Development of on-line Bayesian
learning theory and algorithms.

Shin Ishii (Nara Institute of Science and Technology): Development of 
metalearning algorithms and architectures for adaptive agents.

Yuko Sekino (Gunma University): In vivo and in vitro experiments on
regulation of hippocampal memory by neuromodulators in rats and mice.

Toshiyuki Sawaguchi (Hokkaido University): Experiments on the roles of
neuromodulators in the prefrontal cortex in monkeys.

Shigeto Yamawaki (Hiroshima University): Behavioral and pharmacological
studies on the roles of serotonin in human cognition using fMRI, MEG and TMS.

Kenji Doya (ATR International): Development of a computational theory of
neuromodulator functions; Real and simulated experiments of learning and
communication in multiple agents.

Applicants should send a CV, a statement of research interests, and recent
reprints and/or preprints by January 31st, 2000 to
