Subject: Postdoc position available at SNN Nijmegen
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Post doc position available at SNN, University of Nijmegen, the
Netherlands.

Background:
The group consists of 10 researchers and PhD students and conducts
theoretical and applied research on neural networks and Bayesian
methods. The group is part of the Laboratory of Biophysics which is
involved in experimental brain science.

Recent research of the group has focused on theoretical description of
learning processes using the theory of stochastic processes and the
design of efficient learning rules for Boltzmann machines and other
graphical models using techniques from statistical mechanics; the
extraction of rules from data and the integration of knowledge and
data for modeling; the design of robust methods for confidence
estimation with neural networks. Applied research is conducted on
computer assisted medical diagnosis and prediction tasks. Since 1997,
SNN Nijmegen has founded a company which sells commercial services and
products in the field of neural networks, AI and statistics. For more
information see also http://www.mbfys.kun.nl/SNN

Job specification:
The tasks of the post-doc will be to conduct independent research in
one of the above areas. In addition, it is expected that the post-doc
will initiate novel research and will assist in the supervision of PhD
students.  The postdoc should have a PhD in physics, mathematics or
computer science and a strong theoretical background in neural
networks.  The post-doc salary will be maximally Dfl. 7396 per month,
depending on experience. The position is available for 2 years with
possible extension to 4 years.

Applications:
Interested candidates should send a letter with a CV and list of
publications before 1997 to dr. H.J. Kappen, Stichting Neurale
Netwerken, University of Nijmegen, Geert Grooteplein 21, 6525 EZ
Nijmegen. For information contact dr. H.J. Kappen, +31 24 3614241.
