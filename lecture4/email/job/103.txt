We have a senior faculty position available, for which I would be
delighted to see some modellers or neuroscience people apply.  See my
website, or that of Bill Phillips, Barbara Webb, Peter Cahusac or Lindsay
Wilson to get an idea of what we are currently doing in this area.


Reader / Chair in Psychology

The Department wishes to make an appointment to a post at the level of
Reader or Chair.  The primary role in the early years will be to contribute
to research development in one of the Department's existing areas of
research strength: Perception; Cognition; Neuroscience; Neuropsychology;
Comparative and Developmental Psychology; and Social, Health, Clinical and
Community Psychology.  Teaching and administrative duties in the early years
will be minimal, and there will start-up funding for equipment and
studentships.

Salary will be within the Senior Lecturer scale (£30,396-£34,464) or by
negotiation on the Professorial scale (minimum £35,170).

Informal enquiries may be made to Professor Lindsay Wilson, Head of
Department on 01786 467640, email j.t.l.wilson@stir.ac.uk.  Details of the
Department can be found at:
