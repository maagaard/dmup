			Graduate Training with the
		 Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition

The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition offers an
interdisciplinary doctoral training program operated jointly with nine
affiliated PhD programs at Carnegie Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburgh.  Detailed information about this program is
available on our web site at http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu.

The Center is dedicated to the study of the neural basis of cognitive
processes including learning and memory, language and thought,
perception, attention, and planning; to the study of the development
of the neural substrate of these processes; to the study of disorders
of these processes and their underlying neuropathology; and to the
promotion of applications of the results of these studies to
artificial intelligence, robotics, and medicine.

CNBC students have access to some of the finest facilities for
cognitive neuroscience research in the world: Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners for
functional brain imaging, neurophysiology laboratories for recording
from brain slices and from anesthetized or awake, behaving animals,
electron and confocal microscopes for structural imaging, high
performance computing facilities including an in-house supercomputer
for neural modeling and image analysis, and patient populations for
neuropsychological studies.

Students are admitted jointly to a home department and the CNBC
Training Program.  Applications are encouraged from students with
interests in biology, neuroscience, psychology, engineering, physics,
mathematics, computer science, or robotics.  For a brochure describing
the program and application materials, contact us at the following
