Description of the CNS Department:

The Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems (CNS) provides
advanced training and research experience for graduate students
interested in the neural and computational principles,
mechanisms, and architectures that underlie human and animal
behavior, and the application of neural network architectures to
the solution of outstanding technological problems. Students are
trained in a broad range of areas concerning cognitive and
neural systems, including vision and image processing; speech
and language understanding; adaptive pattern recognition;
cognitive information processing; self-organization; associative
learning and long-term memory; cooperative and competitive
network dynamics and short-term memory; reinforcement,
motivation, and attention; adaptive sensory-motor control and
robotics; and biological rhythms; as well as the mathematical
and computational methods needed to support modeling research
and applications. The CNS Department awards MA, PhD, and BA/MA
degrees.

The CNS Department embodies a number of unique features. It has
developed a curriculum that consists of interdisciplinary
graduate courses, each of which integrates the psychological,
neurobiological, mathematical, and computational information
needed to theoretically investigate fundamental issues
concerning mind and brain processes and the applications of
neural networks to technology. Additional advanced courses,
including research seminars, are also offered. Each course is
typically taught once a week in the afternoon or evening to make
the program available to qualified students, including working
professionals, throughout the Boston area. Students develop a
coherent area of expertise by designing a program that includes
courses in areas such as biology, computer science, engineering,
mathematics, and psychology, in addition to courses in the CNS
curriculum.

The CNS Department prepares students for thesis research with
scientists in one of several Boston University research centers
or groups, and with Boston-area scientists collaborating with
these centers. The unit most closely linked to the department is
the Center for Adaptive Systems.  Students interested in neural
network hardware work with researchers in CNS, at the College
of Engineering, and at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.  Other research
resources include distinguished research groups in neurophysiology,
neuroanatomy, and neuropharmacology at the Medical School and
the Charles River Campus; in sensory robotics, biomedical
engineering, computer and systems engineering, and neuromuscular
research within the College of Engineering; in dynamical systems
within the Mathematics Department; in theoretical computer science
within the Computer Science Department; and in biophysics and
computational physics within the Physics Department.

In addition to its basic research and training program, the
department conducts a seminar series, as well as conferences and
symposia, which bring together distinguished scientists from
both experimental and theoretical disciplines.

The department is housed in its own new four-story building
which includes ample space for faculty and student offices and
laboratories, as well as an auditorium, classroom and seminar
rooms, a library, and a faculty-student lounge.

Below are listed departmental faculty, courses and labs.

In addition, students participate in a weekly colloquium series, an informal
lecture series, and a student-run Journal Club, and attend lectures and
meetings
throughout the Boston area; and advanced students work in small research
groups.


LABORATORY AND COMPUTER FACILITIES

The department is funded by grants and contracts from federal
agencies that support research in life sciences, mathematics,
artificial intelligence, and engineering. Facilities include
laboratories for experimental research and computational
modeling in visual perception, speech and language processing,
and sensory-motor control and robotics. Data analysis and
numerical simulations are carried out on a state-of-the-art
computer network comprised of Sun workstations, Silicon Graphics
workstations, Macintoshes, and PCs.  All students have access to
X-terminals or UNIX workstation consoles, a selection of color
systems and PCs, a network of SGI machines, and standard modeling
and mathematical simulation packages such as Mathematica, VisSim,
Khoros, and Matlab.

The department maintains a core collection of books and
journals, and has access both to the Boston University libraries
and to the many other collections of the Boston Library
Consortium.

In addition, several specialized facilities and software are
available for use.  These include:

Computer Vision/Computational Neuroscience Laboratory

The Computer Vision/Computational Neuroscience Lab is comprised
of an electronics workshop, including a surface-mount
workstation, PCD fabrication tools, and an Alterra EPLD design
system; a light machine shop; an active vision lab including
actuators and video hardware; and systems for computer aided
neuroanatomy and application of computer graphics and image
processing to brain sections and MRI images.

Neurobotics Laboratory

The Neurobotics Lab utilizes wheeled mobile robots to study
potential applications of neural networks in several areas,
including adaptive dynamics and kinematics, obstacle avoidance,
path planning and navigation, visual object recognition, and
conditioning and motivation. The lab currently has three Pioneer
robots equipped with sonar and visual sensors; one B-14 robot
with a moveable camera, sonars, infrared, and bump sensors; and
two Khepera miniature robots with infrared proximity detectors.
Other platforms may be investigated in the future.

Psychoacoustics Laboratory

The Psychoacoustics Lab houses a newly installed, 8 ft. x 8 ft.
sound-proof booth.  The laboratory is  extensively equipped to
perform both traditional psychoacoustic experiments and
experiments using interactive auditory virtual-reality stimuli.
The major equipment dedicated to the psychoacoustics laboratory
includes two Pentium-based personal computers; two
Power-PC-based Macintosh computers; a 50-MHz array processor
capable of generating auditory stimuli in real time;
programmable attenuators; analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters; a real-time head tracking system;
a special-purpose, signal-processing hardware system capable of
generating "spatialized" stereo auditory signals in real time; a
two-channel oscilloscope; a two-channel spectrum analyzer;
various cables, headphones, and other miscellaneous electronics
equipment; and software for signal generation, experimental
control, data analysis, and word processing.

Sensory-Motor Control Laboratory

The Sensory-Motor Control Lab supports experimental studies of
motor kinematics. An infrared WatSmart system allows measurement
of large-scale movements, and a pressure-sensitive graphics
tablet allows studies of handwriting and other fine-scale
movements.  Equipment includes a 40-inch monitor that allows
computer display of animations generated by an SGI workstation
or a Pentium Pro (Windows NT) workstation.  A second major
component is a helmet-mounted, video-based, eye-head tracking
system (ISCAN Corp, 1997).  The latter's camera samples eye
position at 240Hz and also allows reconstruction of what
subjects are attending to as they freely scan a scene under
normal lighting.  Thus the system affords a wide range of
visuo-motor studies.

Speech and Language Laboratory

The Speech and Language Lab includes facilities for
analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog software conversion.
Ariel equipment allows reliable synthesis and playback of
speech waveforms.  An Entropic signal processing package
provides facilities for detailed analysis, filtering, spectral
construction, and formant tracking of the speech waveform.
Various large databases, such as TIMIT and TIdigits, are
available for testing algorithms of speech recognition.  For
high speed processing, supercomputer facilities speed
filtering and data analysis.

Visual Psychophysics Laboratory

The Visual Psychophysics Lab occupies an 800-square-foot suite,
including three dedicated rooms for data collection, and houses
a variety of computer controlled display platforms, including
Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx RE2, SGI Indigo2 High Impact,
SGI Indigo2 Extreme, Power Computing (Macintosh compatible)
PowerTower Pro 225, and Macintosh 7100/66 workstations.
Ancillary resources for visual psychophysics include a
computer-controlled video camera, stereo viewing glasses,
prisms, a photometer, and a variety of display-generation,
data-collection,  and data-analysis software.

Affiliated Laboratories

Affiliated CAS/CNS faculty have additional laboratories ranging
from visual and auditory psychophysics and neurophysiology,
anatomy, and neuropsychology to engineering and chip design.
These facilities are used in the context of faculty/student
collaborations.
