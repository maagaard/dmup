Postdoctoral and Graduate Student Positions in
Computational Neuroscience

Neural Information Processing Group, Department of Computer Science,
Technical University of Berlin, Germany


One postdoctoral and one graduate student fellowship are available for
candidates, who are interested to work on computational models of primary
visual cortex. The successful candidates may choose between the following
topics:

- Dynamics of cortical circuits including the role of steppy connections
  and fast synaptic plasticity.
- Representation of information in the visual cortex.
- Development of neural circuits and the functional organization of visual
  cortex (cortical maps).

The candidates are expected to join an ongoing collaboration with
experimental neurobiologists in the group of Jennifer Lund (Institute of
Ophthalmology, University College London) Positions will start in summer /
fall 1999. The postdoctoral position will be initially for one year, but
an extension is possible.

The CS department of the Technical University of Berlin approves students
with foreign Masters or Diplom degrees for graduate study when certain
standards w.r.t. the subject, grades, and the awarding institution are met.
The university also allows for a thesis defense in the English language.

Interested candidates please send their CV, transcripts of their
certificates, a short statement of their research interest, and a list of
publications to:

Prof. Klaus Obermayer
FR2-1, NI, Informatik, Technische Universitaet Berlin
