Postdoctoral Trainee (two positions). Analysis of visual
structure-from-motion in primates.  Representation of optic flow and
attention in temporal (STPa) and parietal lobes (7a) are being
examined in the awake behaving monkey.  These studies utilize single
unit recording, optical recording, microdialysis techniques.
Laboratory also has ongoing fMRI, human psychophysical studies and
computational studies.  Recent graduates who are changing fields from
either cellular or computational neuroscience to behavioral and
physiological studies are particularly encouraged to apply.  Computer
expertise useful, but not necessary.  Superb experimental and
computational facilities in a multi-disciplinary research center.
NY-NJ Metro area.
