		University of Edinburgh
	Centre for Interactive Image Analysis

   Research Fellows in Computational Functional MRI

This is an exciting new venture to visualise the working of the human
brain during cognitive tasks using a new research MR scanner.  The
Centre for Interactive Image Analysis is run by the SHEFC Brain
Imaging Research Center for Scotland and the Institute for Adpative
and Neural Computation at the University of Edinburgh.  Working
closely together, the two postholders will jointly engage in the
following aspects of the Centre's work:

     * establish functional imaging on a research MRI scanner, including
     the stimulus presentation system, software and interfacing.

     * work with cognitive scientists and clinicians to define, establish
     and run suitable test paradigms on healthy volunteers and patients

     * establish networking, image-processing, analysis, visualisation and
     archiving facilities for scientific and clinical data obtained in fMRI
     studies.

     * work with cognitive scientists and clinicians to explore the uses of
     real-time and near-real-tiem analysis techniques in fMRI studies.

The postholders will be encouraged to undertake original research in
one or more of the following areas of fMRI: novel pulse sequences;
statistical models of physical and physiological noise; cognitive
modelling; parallel statistical and image-processing algorithms;
visualisation techniques.

Candidates should hold a higher degree in an appropriate subject and should
be familiar with PC and/or Unix computing.  Expertise in cognitive
modelling, MRI, statistics, image analysis, and visualisation are highly
desirable.  At least one postholder will have experience with parallel
computing on Unix platforms.

Salary scale: 15,735-23,651 p.a.  Both posts are tenable for 3 years
initially with renewal subject to success in attracting further funding.

Closing date: 6 November 1998. Interviews are expected 16-20 November 1998.
