Postdoctoral position at the University of California, San Francisco;
in the Laboratory of Dr. Michael Weiner.

The research involves the development and comparison of statistical 
classification techniques for medical imaging data. Knowledge of 
some subset of the following topics is important: feature extraction
techniques, such as projection pursuit or principal component analysis,
and cluster analysis techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis,
CART, neural networks, or Bayesian techniques. While these are 
important, significant stress will be placed on the development of novel
classification techniques based on recently proposed measures of 
structural complexity. Development of metrics for comparison of the 
new techniques with more standard ones will be an important 
component of the research. The candidate will also contribute to the 
design of a medical image data warehouse that is optimized for use by 
the automated classification techniques. Some familiarity with medical
imaging would be useful but is not required; primary interaction will
be with research physicists and mathematicians in Dr. Weiner's group
and from the Santa Fe Institute.
