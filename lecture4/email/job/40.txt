            Computational Neurobiology Graduate Program
      Department of Biology  -- University of California, San Diego 

The Computational Neurobiology Graduate Program at UCSD will 
provide students with rigorous training in neuroscience including 
experimental methods and modern mathematical methods to 
analyze and visualize data as well as theoretical approaches to neuronal 
dynamics and computation. Candidates from a wide range of 
backgrounds are invited to apply, including Biology, Psychology,
Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics.

All students are expected to master set of core courses to insure a common 
set of knowledge and a common language.   All students will take the 
"Advanced Neurobiology Laboratory", which presents state-of-the-art 
imaging and electrophysiological techniques, modern techniques in 
genetic and viral transformation for the study of neuronal function, and 
modern statistical and spectral methods for data analysis, and "Advanced 
Computational Methods and Dynamic Systems Theory" which include 
training in nonlinear dynamics of single cells, the analysis of regularly 
spiking and bursting cells, as well as reduced models and their 
representation in phase space. 

Requests for application materials should be sent to the Graduate
Admissions Office, Department of Biology 0348, 9500 Gilman Drive,
UCSD, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0348: [gradprog@biology.ucsd.edu].

An initial pre-application form will be sent; applicants should indicate
their interest in the Computational Neurobiology Graduate Program on
this form. These forms will be screened and application forms will be
sent to appropriate candidates. The deadline for completed application
materials, including letters of reference, is January 8, 1999.
