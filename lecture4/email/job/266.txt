The NEC Research Institute (NECI) has immediate openings for
outstanding researchers in computer science.  Candidates are expected 
to establish a basic research program of international stature.  
Ph.D.s are required.

NECI currently has programs in theory; machine learning; web computing;
computer vision; computational linguistics; operating systems, 
programming languages and compilers; and parallel architecture.

We are primarily seeking applicants who work on machine learning of 
relevance to web applications, or on systems with relevance to web 
applications.  However, we will also give consideration to exceptional 
applicants in any of our existing areas of focus.

The NEC Research Institute, founded ten years ago, has as its mission 
basic research in Computer Science and Physics underlying future
computer and communication technologies.  The Institute offers unusual 
opportunities in that:

1)Members are free to decide on their own basic research directions and
projects;
2)Positions include budgets for research, support staff, travel, and
equipment;  and
3)All results are published in the open literature.

Located near Princeton, NJ, NECI has close ties with many outstanding
research universities in the area.  The Institute's laboratories are
state-of-the-art and include several high-end parallel compute
servers. For more details about NECI, see http://www.neci.nj.nec.com.

Applicants must show documentation of eligibility for employment. NECI
is an equal opportunity employer.  Full applications should include 
resumes, copies of selected publications, names of at least three 
references, and a two-page statement of proposed research directions.
Applications will be reviewed beginning February 1, 2000.
