***************** Post-Doctoral Research Associate  ****************

                      OREGON GRADUATE INSTITUTE 

The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (OGI) has an
an immediate opening for a motivated Ph.D. to participate in an
interdisciplinary autonomous controls project.  Initial appointment is
for a one-year period, with the possibility for extension depending on
performance and availability of funding.


This is a joint project with the Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dept, the Center for Coastal and Land-Margin Research (CCALMR,
http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu) and the Pacific Software Research Center
(PacSoft, http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/).


SOFTWARE ENABLED CONTROL PROJECT OVERVIEW:

With the increase in on-board computational resources, optimal
nonlinear control can be derived from accurate real-time computational
models of a vehicle and its physical environment.  This
multidisciplinary project couples advances in dynamic vehicle modeling,
large-scale environmental forecasting, software engineering, and
recent advances in nonlinear control.  The objectives are to
demonstrate rapid dynamic reconfiguration of control laws and the
ability to perform complex maneuvers.

Progress to date has focused on optimal neural control approaches for
trajectory generation of surface vessels navigating in forecasted flow
fields of the Columbia River Estuary.  Future direction of the program
will expand to aerospace environments, and may investigate a number
of possible different control paradigms


CANDIDATE QUALIFICATIONS:

Candidates should have a Ph.D. with strong expertise in control
theory, neural networks and reinforcement learning.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

The successful candidate will work with Eric A. Wan
(http://www.ece.ogi.edu/~ericwan/) and his research group and
collaborators.

Please send inquiries and background information to
ericwan@ece.ogi.edu.
