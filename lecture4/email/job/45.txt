Postdoctoral Fellows Program 

	Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology 
		at the 
	University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 


This is an invitation to apply for postdoctoral fellowships at the
Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 


   The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is an inter- and
   multidisciplinary research institute devoted to basic research in
   the physical sciences and engineering, and in the life and
   behavioral sciences. Its primary mission is to foster
   interdisciplinary work of the highest quality in an environment
   that transcends many of the limitations inherent in traditional
   university organizations and structures.

   Research at the Institute focuses on three broadly defined themes:
   biological intelligence, human-computer intelligent interaction,
   and molecular and electronic nanostructures.  Eighteen research
   groups, composed of faculty and students from sixteen UIUC
   departments, work within and across these three areas.


Many research areas that are of interest to readers of this list are
relevant to Beckman Institute research in general and to the
postdoctoral fellows program in particular.

All aspects of the learning sciences (Computational, Biological,
etc. ), Natural Language (Computational aspects, Psycholinguistics),
and many other topics in Biological and Artificial Intelligence are of
interest.

Please consult the Beckman Institute web page at 
http://www.beckman.uiuc.edu/

and the Beckman fellows program at
http://www.beckman.uiuc.edu/outreach/fellowshome.html

If interested, don't hesitate to contact me directly for further
information. Notice that the due date for applying is January 8.

	Dan
