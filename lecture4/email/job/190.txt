The Sloan Center for Theoretical Neurobiology at UCSF solicits
applications for pre- and post-doctoral fellowships, with the goal of
bringing theoretical approaches to bear on neuroscience. Applicants
should have a strong background and education in mathematics,
theoretical or experimental physics, or computer science, and
commitment to a future research career in neuroscience. Prior
biological or neuroscience training is not required.

The Sloan Center offers opportunities to combine theoretical and
experimental approaches to understanding the operation of the intact
brain. Young scientists with strong theoretical backgrounds will
receive scientific training in experimental approaches to
understanding the operation of the intact brain. They will learn to
integrate their theoretical abilities with these experimental
approaches to form a mature research program in integrative
neuroscience. The research undertaken by the trainees may be
theoretical, experimental, or a combination.

Resident Faculty of the Sloan Center and their research interests
include:

Allison Doupe:       Development of song recognition and production in
                     songbirds
Stephen Lisberger:   Learning and memory in a simple motor reflex, the
                     vestibulo-ocular reflex, and visual guidance of
                     smooth pursuit eye movements by the cerebral cortex
Michael Merzenich:   Experience-dependent plasticity underlying learning
                     in the adult cerebral cortex, and the neurological
                     bases of learning disabilities in children
Kenneth Miller:      Circuitry of the cerebral cortex: its structure,
                     self-organization, and computational function (primarily
                     using cat primary visual cortex as a model system)
Roger Nicoll:        Synaptic and cellular mechanisms of learning and
		     memory in the hippocampus
Christoph Schreiner: Cortical mechanisms of perception of complex
                     sounds such as speech in adults, and plasticity of
                     speech recognition in children and adults 
Michael Stryker:     Mechanisms that guide development of the visual
                     cortex

There are also a number of visiting faculty, including Larry Abbott,
Brandeis University; Bill Bialek, NEC Research; Sebastian Seung, MIT;
David Sparks, Baylor University; Steve Zucker, Yale University.

TO APPLY, please send a curriculum vitae, a statement of previous
research and research goals, up to three relevant publications, and
have two letters of recommendation sent to us.

            The application deadline is February 1, 2000. 

Send applications to: 

                        Steve Lisberger
          Sloan Center for Theoretical Neurobiology at UCSF
                    Department of Physiology
                     University of California
                       513 Parnassus Ave.
                  San Francisco, CA 94143-0444

PRE-DOCTORAL applicants with strong theoretical training may seek
admission into the UCSF Neuroscience Graduate Program as a first-year
student. Applicants seeking such admission must apply by Jan. 5, 2000
to be considered for fall, 2000 admission. Application materials for
the UCSF Neuroscience Program may be obtained from
http://www.neuroscience.ucsf.edu/neuroscience/admission.html or from

                         Cindy Kelly 
                 Neuroscience Graduate Program 
                    Department of Physiology 
               University of California San Francisco 
                  San Francisco, CA 94143-0444 
                   neuroscience@phy.ucsf.edu 

Be sure to include your surface-mail address. The procedure is: make a
normal application to the UCSF Neuroscience program; but also alert
the Sloan Center of your application, by writing to Steve Lisberger at
the address given above.
