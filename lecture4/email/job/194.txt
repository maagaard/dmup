Subject: Research position in fMRI applied to neurorecovery after stroke
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Research position in Computational Functional MRI at Brain and Vision
Research Laboratory, Boston University

This is a newly-funded full-time  research appointment

aimed at  quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the statistical
and temporal characteristics of brain activations during restorative
plasticity in the human brain after stroke.

The  postholder will jointly engage in the following aspects of the
Lab's work:

     * establish functional imaging on a research MRI scanner,
including

     the stimulus development, presentation system, software and
interfacing.

     * work with  clinicians to define, establish  and run suitable
test paradigms on healthy volunteers and patients

     *  image-processing, analysis, visualisation of  clinical data
obtained in fMRI studies

 * work with MT physicists, psychophysicists and  clinicians to explore
the uses of near-real-time analysis techniques in fMRI studies, and to
develop software that tracks the dynamics and changes of activatios
over time.

The postholders should be able to undertake original research in one
or more of the following areas of fMRI: statistical models of physical
and physiological noise; data modelling; parallel statistical and
image-processing algorithms; visualisation techniques, application of
various techniques to quantify changes in fMRI images.

Candidates should hold a higher degree in computer csience, engineering
or physics  and should be familiar with PC and Unix computing.  
Expertise in statistical and cognitive  modelling, MRI,  image
analysis, and visualisation are highly desirable.  

Further particulars should be obtained from:
