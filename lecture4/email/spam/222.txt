Rondal Gold Corporation (Alberta Stock Exchange symbol RGD.AL) has started the 
long awaited 
drilling on its Zacatecas site in Mexico. Company President, Dalton Dupasquier, has 
indicated 
that he will travel to personally assess the progress of the drilling which contains an 
anomaly 
trending north south which is over two full km. in length and almost half a kilometer 
wide. All 
targets require drilling to moderate, to deep levels where both the maximum 
chargeabilities occur 
and the anomalies are best defined.

This company milestone will reactivate the investment community's interest in Rondal 
Gold 
Corporation which stand to gains substantially from a possible copper find due to the 
low 
operating costs with which it can process at levels far below other copper production 
sites. This 
interest from the investment community will also be derived from the close proximity 
this site has to 
Western Copper Holding's (WTC TSE currently trading at over $3) successfully 
proven reserves 
found only a few km. to the south of Rondal Gold Corp.'s drilling site. 

Base metals as well as precious metals are expected to rise due to market instability 
and a 
resulting flight to safety and quality. The expert team that Rondal Gold has put 
together will most 
surely capitalize on the unique opportunity that the Zacatecas site represents for the 
company 
and its shareholders.
