Dear Reader,

For the past 12 months we have been developing a brand new search engine
system. Over this time we have sent out a number of robots around the
Internet to search out and store web sites details on all subjects. However
we need to control how we go about allowing sites into our engine.

You can now submit your web site to our search engine
http://www.marchsearch.com and have our robots ordered to visit your site(s)
first, and then on regular intervals we will return to update your site.

Our aim is to store a vast amount of web sites and details, we do this by
the use of Meta Keywords and Meta Descriptions and Page Titles, so make sure
these are correct and really describe your site before submitting. If you
need some help on doing this then read below, otherwise please spend a few
minutes to apply your sites information, it's going to do nothing but help
you or your business.

ADDING META INFORMATION TO YOUR WEB PAGES:
-----------------------------------------

Add meta Information to the top of your html pages between the <HEAD> and
</HEAD> as shown below. It really is important to add these to the every
page on your site, but in the worst case and as a start place them on your
main site pages, and then target these in search engines like March Search.
A recent study discovered that only 32% of web sites had Meta Tags. Meta
Tags are still the most effective way of targetting visitors to your site.

<HEAD>
<TITLE>Your Sites Name HERE and short sentence/description about your site
of around 15 words in length</TITLE>
<META content="Add around 25 keywords that are on the subject of your site
placing a comma (,) between each word" name=KEYWORDS>
<META content="Add a sentence about your site around 30 words in length. A
good tip is to expand your sites Title" name=DESCRIPTION>
</HEAD>
