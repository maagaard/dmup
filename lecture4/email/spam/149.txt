Here are just a few of the VITAL AREAS that
you'll be discussing with our team member;

 1) Load Time - How long does your web site take
    to load?  How long should it take?  What about
    visitors who are using 14.4 or 28.8 baud modems?
    There are still millions of them in use.  What
    can you do to help speed things up?

 2) HTML Design - How well is your site programmed?
    Do you have any areas that are causing you 
    critical problems of which you may not even be
    aware? 

    What about META Tags?  Do you know how vitally
    important they are with regard to search engines?
    Did you or your programmer include them?
    These are CRITICAL.

 3) Search Engines, Directories and Indices - Are 
    you ready for them?  Is your web site 
    programmed to take full advantage of their 
    power?  Where in the list of your competitors 
    will you wind up?

 4) How Browser Friendly Is Your Web Site - Did you
    know that various versions of browsers can't 
    even show certain types of web pages?  Is your 
    site one of the thousands that can't even be 
    seen by certain browsers that are being used 
    this very day?

 5) What About Dead Links - These are links in your
    site that point to other pages or web sites. 
    Have you checked all your links to make certain
    that they are still functioning as planned?

 6) How Popular Is Your Site - Are there other web
    sites that are linked to your site?  This can 
    help you in your web site positioning.

 7) Spelling Accuracy - This is where you can really 
    make yourself look unprofessional.  Have you 
    checked all your spelling?
