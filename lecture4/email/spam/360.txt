US ONLINE NETWORK Gives Free Computers Away! Public Stock Offering!
                       UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY!
>Internet, Telecommunications, & Computer Company Goes Public! 
>Announcing our IPO - Initial Public Offering:
1 MILLION SHARES / $1.00 per share. Minimum purchase - $250.00
USONET.COM - U. S. Online Network/Communications Consulting Corp.,
is a profitable expanding company with an aggressive marketing plan. 
>>From October 1997 through October 1998, the Company has sold local dial tone contracts with an aggregate value of  $9,600,000 dollars. The
Company has received commissions for initiating the services.  At
present the company or one of its subsidiaries has Agent or Master Agent
agreements with LDI, Sprint, Cable & Wireless, and Net-tel. The company
offers local dial tone and network services for Bell Atlantic under a
referral agreement.
The Company offers web site design & development, web site hosting,
Internet marketing & advertising, domain name registration services,
Internet access services, and marketing on-hold systems and custom built
computers as a direct provider under its Info4biz heading.

MARKETING: We are giving away FREE INTERNET COMPUTERS - The "IPC" - To
everyone who wants one, with no credit check required, as long as they
are on our Internet service. Customers agree to use our service for two
years. This program is positioned to appeal to the 50% of the population
that does not have computers or Internet access at this time. Due to
this plan all indicators predict rapid growth of our Internet customer
base, which would then comprise a large virtual community, and database.
The benefit to the company and its shareholders is twofold: 1) The
company will develop a large subscriber base in a short period of time
while earning profits. 2) The customers will log on to the company's
virtual communities as a home portal to the Internet. These customers
become members of the communities and in turn increase the potential for
advertising revenue from our own sales of products and services via the
Internet and commission generated from sales of outside vendors via
links, thereby increasing shareholder value.
The Company plans to tie all its sales efforts together by offering a
number of bundled services targeted toward segmented markets throughout
its customer base. The Company will cross sell its products and other
commissionable products utilizing its three sales channels.

Note: We are negotiating an agreement with DC Corp,
a $40,000,000 dollar company, which specializes in the Latin American
market both in the US and in the Caribbean and South America, to
distribute our FREE Internet Computers bundled with our Internet
service, in their over 75 retail outlets plus many more, owned by
others, in which they have distribution. This alone will enable us to
obtain thousands of Internet computer clients in this largely untapped
market in a brief period of time. In addition, the CEO of DC Corp is
on our Board of Directors. Our Internet service has over 450 US POPS and
300 international pops from UK, Europe, Canada, to Japan, including
Caribbean and South American markets. It is noted for speed and
excellence of service, support, and lack of busy's. We provide Windows
95 and tech support in Spanish as well as English.
