Dear Windows User,

Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 3.x, 95 and 98
to nearly the level of Windows NT, Microsoft's professional and
industrial version of Windows.  

The new WinFix(tm) 4.2 is a very effective way to improve the
reliability of Windows, because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and
self-repairing. And WinFix is very safe, because it operates
completely independent of Windows. 

WinFix is the safest, most effective way to keep you working, by
keeping your PC working non-stop.  To find out more about WinFix,
send and email to kikoman76@bigfoot.com with the subject "winfix"

*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
This announcement is aimed at PC users who asked to be kept
informed about new developments in Windows(tm) technology.
