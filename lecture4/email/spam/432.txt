LOOK AT THIS!

THIS MAY BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LETTER YOU RECEIVE 
THIS YEAR!!

Please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully,
immediately print and READ TWICE.

Greetings,

Hopefully my name is still on the list.  When I first read the letter,
 I thought it was some off-the-wall idea to make money.  A week
 later, I met again with my client to discuss the issue.  I told him 
that the letter originally brought to me was not 100% legal.  
I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will 
be alright.

I was curious about the letter, so he told me how it works.  
I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against participating.  
Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to 
his results.  About two months later,  he called to tell me that 
he had received over $800,000 in cash!!  I didn't believe him 
so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself.  I thought 
about it for a few days and decided that there was not much
 too lose.  I followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 
200 letters.  Sure enough the money started coming in!!  It 
came slowly at first, but after three weeks, I was getting more 
than I could open in a day.  After about three months the 
money stopped coming.  I kept a precise record of my 
earnings and at the end they totaled $868,439.00!

I was earning a good living as a lawyer, but as anyone 
in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress
 that comes with the job.  I told myself if things worked
 out I would retire from practice and play golf.  I decided
 to try the letter again, but this time I sent out 500 letters. 
 Well, three months after that, I had totaled $2,344,178.00!! 
 I just couldn't believe it.  I met my old client for lunch to find 
out how this exactly works.  He told me that there were a
 few similar letters going around.  What made this one
different is the fact that there are seven names on the 
letter, not five like most others.  This fact, alone, resulted 
in more returns.  The other factor was the advice I gave 
him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, 
since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal.

I bet now you are curious about what changes I told him to 
make.  Well, if you send a letter like this out, to be legal, 
you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. 
 I told him that any-one sending a dollar out must receive 
something in return.  So when you send a dollar to each
 of the seven names on the list, you must include a piece
 of paper saying "please put me on you mailing list" and
include your name, mailing address.

Follow the simple instructions below exactly, and in less
that three months, you will receive over $800,000.00.

B)  Mail a $1 bill (wrapped in a piece of blank paper) to each
 of the seven names below.  Include a note (typed or handwritten
 saying "Please add me to your mailing list" and include 
your name and mailing address.

1.  S. Imhoff PO Box 157 Carey, OH 43316-0157
2.  CB 322 Courtland Ave Ste 109 San Francisco, CA  94110
3.  G. McDermott PO Box 1420 East Orleans, MA  02643-1420
4.  H.W. Daughtry 4128 Amanda Lane  Cumming, GA  30040
5.  J.D. Scarborough 600 Lakeshore Dr. Cordele, GA  31015
6.  J Tubbs  1678 S. Fountainhead Rd  Ft. Myers, FL 33919
7.  Dantini PO Box 503 Sherman, TX  75091-0503

B)  Remove the name next to #1 at the top of the list and 
move the rest of the names up one position.  Then place your 
name in the #7 spot.  This is done by saving this to a file and
 enter it in your information on line #7.  Be very careful when
you type the addresses and proof and read them.

C)  When you have completed the above instructions, you have
 options of mailing your new letter in two ways. 1) Through US
Postal Service or 2) through e-mail. This letter has been proven
perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above 
instructions, because you're purchasing membership in our 
exclusive mailing list.  To mail this out over the internet, you
could browse through areas and find people to send this to
all the time.  All you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses 
wherever you are on the internet.  Or you can use Mass E-mail
Network to mail out in large volumes for you.  We highly 
recommend this one.  They always e-mail more than the amount 
you purchase and their addresses are fresh.  E-mail this letter 
to them with your name and addresses in position #7 above.

friends as well.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL!!!
(refer to title 18, section 1302 & 1342 of the U.S. Postal and Lottery 
Laws)

Assume for example, that you get 7.5% return rate, which is 
very conservative.  My first attempt was about 9.5% and my 
second was over 11%.

1)  When you mail out 200 letters, 15 people will send 
out $1.00
2)  Those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people 
send you $1.00
3)  Those 225 mail out 200 letters and 3,375 people 
send you $1.00
4)  Those 3,375 people mail out 200 letters and 50,625 
send you $1.00
5)  Those 50,625 people mail out 200 letters and 759,375 people 
send you $1.00
6)  Those 759,375 people mail out 200 letters and 11,390,625 people 
send you $1.00

At this point, your name drops off the list.  Think about it.  
With only the first six levels, you have received over 
$813,615.00!!

Smile all the way to the bank.
