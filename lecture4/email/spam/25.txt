Dear Investor,




With Banks making record profits of $ 800 000 000 - $ 1.5 billion and over a year and with unjustified service charges. We would like to present a new  way at battling this service charge frenzy and to contribute back to the community by helping any one of our list of charitable organisations or one of your choice.  Below is a brief description of our investment objective.

Invest as little as $1.00 USD or more to Start your own Bank in Panama.

Panamanian Offshore Banks require as liittle as $1 000 000.00 USD in paid in 
capital to qualify for Bank registration.

Your $1.00 investment or more can lead you to an unlimited return.

Once our Bank is registered, a prospectus will be drawn up including all the necessary documents required by the Securities Commission of Panama and we will apply for public status otherwise known as an IPO.

An IPO is an initial public offering, which allows you to trade your stock freely between shareholders and the public.

Our Bank will concentrate on the usage of the internet to reduce overhead as well has have the upmost personal touch for commercial, personal and private banking.

Our sevice charges, which will be few, will be unbeatable. You don't have to maintain a fixed minimum balance, no costly wire transfer fees.  No balance inquiry ATM fees and no withdrawal fees. Check processing fees will be low as well as many other fees, if any.

We also will select a group of charities in which 5-8 % of our profits will go to, if you have a charity in mind please e-mail the charitys home page url or send documentation by mail to the address below.

Debit card facilities as well as checking accounts will be available for quick easy access to clients cashflow.

Panama has also been infamous for their banking secrecy, they have 116 different banks and are subjected to strict secrecy laws, so for whatever reason you might have for keeping your assets confidential, banking in Panama can definitely cater to your needs.

To invest as little as one dollar without furthering any other costs.  Write your name and address and a contact telephone number and e-mail address on a blank piece of paper and fold it and put $1.00 or more USD between the folds, so no one can see the contents through the envelope.

You can also write a check for amounts of $10.00 - $100.00 USD.

Money orders or bank drafts are required for amounts over $100.00 USD

You may also send all of the above in the equivalent popular foreign currencys.

Please send to the address below and a contract will be e-mailed to you when the funds have been cleared in the case of cash, money orders or bank drafts the contract will go out immediately. Allow 2-3 weeks for personal checks.

For large investments we can arrange for an interest bearing investment deposit while we are completing the investment objective.

In the event the objective to bring together $1 000 000.00 USD for the investment project, if our attempt to register a Bank in Panama fails, as is stated in the contract your funds will be totally refunded and you will be frequently notified of the status of the investment via e-mail.

We also specialize in offshore banking and private trusts, please feel free to write us with your requirements at the address below.
