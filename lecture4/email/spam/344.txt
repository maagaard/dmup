Dear Andy,

There is an example fMRI dataset available at
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/ that you may find useful. It's a
simple auditory activation experiment that we acquired a few years ago and
use on the SPM course, and should be helpful in testing/learning SPM. Both
raw (i.e. needing realignment, normalising and smoothing) and
pre-processed (ready for statistics) timeseries are available. 

Best wishes,

Geraint
