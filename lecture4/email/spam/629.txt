SORRY IF THIS AD HAS OFFENDED YOU IN ANYWAY. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THE AD PLEASE NO FLAMES, JUST DELETE, YOU TAKE MORE TIME TO COMPLAIN THEN TO JUST DELETE.
Now to explain how the whole process works. First of all, you tell us how many e-mail addresses you would like us to send your advertisement to--you may either e-mail, fax, or snail-mail a hard copy of your ad to us. 

We will then place your ad in our database so it will be ready to be sent out anytime thereafter. Say for instance you wanted 1-million e-mails sent--once we receive your payment it will take about  3-4 days to be completed, unless you desire a more lengthy time frame, or need it done faster.

Right about now you might be wondering why you should choose us above the competitors. Well, we can sum it up for you in one simple word: Assurance. We are able to e-mail you uploaded logs of your sendings in order to provide you with verification. These maillogs will display the time and date that we completed the mailings as well as the actual e-mail addresses that your ad was sent to along with a "recipient okay" tag. This tag will confirm that the address were valid--now that is the assurance that you deserve, wouldn't you agree? WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN BUSINESS IN CA FOR OVER 2 YEARS.

In addition to this, we offer targeted lists just starting at $400.00 for 1 million. Finally, I must inform you that your ad, if being sent to AOL, may have all the HTML, colored and enlarged fonts as well as colored background. When you are ready to order, just contact us and we will e-mail you an invoice for you to sign and send with your payment.   For the target lists it is best that you call or e-mail back to us letting us know what type of target and we will let you know if we have the target you are looking for.  

Some of our targets that we have are: business opportunity seekers, cigar smokers, businesses in the US, people seeking health products, homeowners, all females, all males, adult site seekers, some of the major states in the US, online purchasers, singles, golf related interests, sports fanatics, please call for more info, most targets are on request basis, it really just depends on what you are searching for.  Our targets are gathered by search keywords or member directory data bases like from AOL, Bigfoot or Mindspring, etc.  Call for more info 209-669-3628
