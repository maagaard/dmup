Wake up and open your eyes to the monstorous destructions 
 done on humanity, created by fabricators of war.

* Do you actually believe that the war that is going 
      on in Yugoslavia is not killing anyone?

* Do you actually believe that there is no blood being spilled?  

* Do you believe that you, your children, your friends will actually 
   escape death from these criminals of war?

* Refugees are being used as a pretense and media manipulates 
   scenes just so that people can see what they want us 
   to see and not see reality.

  WAKE UP!

The ecological damage that is being made today and that was 
 made during the Gulf war has already killed 70,000 American soldiers.  

The damage has also destoyed the lives of people that live in these 
 regions from the inhalation of poison in the atmosphere!

If, in the near future, you are to visit any of the neighboring 
 countries where the Kosovo war is happening today, you will be 
 exposed to radioactivity!

If you happen to be working near these regions or find a job 
 near these regions, you too will be exposed to the poison 
 radioactivity of the war.  Are you aware what may happen to someone 
 that is exposed to radioactivity?

Death comes in stages.  The the poison stays  in ones body nurturing cancer!

If the well being and future of the Ethnic Albanians were a 
 great concern, does it make sense to use weapons as poisonous as these?  
 You know why this war started and that is for economic interests of 
 the United States of America.

You know why John F. Keneddy was assaninated, but you must realize that 
 you must wake up for this also!

You may have believed that when the Gulf war was happening, you were 
 too far from the dangers of the conflict.  
 That the people that died there and continue to die today do not affect you.  

Then, how do you feel now that the war is closer to us than ever?  
Tomorrow, it may be as close as in your own country!  
WHY?  
So that 100 people can profit economically and that we may be asleep all our lives?

PEOPLE!  WAKE UP!  THEY ARE KILLING US!!

Albert Einstein says:
I would like to make a proposal to all men and women, university students, 
 scholars and all that are humble, to declare that they will deny any further aid to 
 the war and participation in assisting to prepare for any war now and in the future!

We must dedicate our lives to stray away from the the makings of any war:
 the factories of missiles.  



Best wishes, for a better world.
