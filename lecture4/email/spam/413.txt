Company Press Release
 

WCollect.com Joins With Oldest Collectible Book Club to Bring $3 
Million in Limited Edition Books and Related Art Online
 
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 13, 1999--WCollect.com 
(OTC BB:WCLT), a unique, e-commerce site specializing exclusively 
in offering authentic collectibles and entertainment memorabilia online 
has recently entered into a significant relationship with The Limited 
Editions Club, the oldest collectible book club in the United States. 
 
This affiliation, with Club owner Sid Shiff, will bring a $3 million 
dollar collection of limited edition books and artwork to a broader 
base of collectors who wish to purchase the ultimate in collectible 
books online. 
 
For seventy years, Picasso, Cartier-Bresson, Matisse, Ellsworth 
Kelly, deKooning, Motherwell, Balthus, Mapplethorpe and Elizabeth 
Catlett provided original prints to illustrate books by Bronte, Maya 
Angelou, Ezra Pound, Octavio Paz, Langston Hughes, Samuel 
Beckett and others for The Limited Editions Club. 
 
These highly collectible books and prints, originally created exclusively 
for members of The Limited Editions Club, can be found in the Museum 
of Modern Art and in the homes of some of the world's most selective 
collectors. The books are all signed and numbered and most editions 
are limited to 300 copies. Book's range in price from $1,000 to $10,000, 
with limited sets of artist prints from $3,000 to $80,000. 
 
Limited Editions Club books are not only visually spectacular but have 
become excellent investments. According to Carol Grossman, in the 
March, 1999 issue of BIBLIO, ``Jacob Lawrence's Genesis, in an 
edition of 400 brings at least $3,500, up nearly five times from the 
original price. The Season in Hell, with photogravures by Mapplethorpe 
and a print run of 1,000 now brings $2,500. The recent edition of Ezra 
Pound's Cathay illustrated by Clemente and originally issued at $1,250, 
now sells in the $3,000 range.'' 
 
Investments were not what led Sid Shiff, former Wall Street Banker, 
to take over one of the oldest limited editions book clubs in the 
United States. It was his love for collectible art and ``great books'' 
that has put him into the unique position to create sumptuous books 
illustrated, with original artwork, that sell for thousands of dollars 
to his club members. WCollect.com is proud to now offer these highly 
unique and limited editions to online collectors. 
 
By focusing on exclusive and authenticated items and commissioned 
products in a virtually untapped niche market, and with the explosion 
of growth in the arena of collectibles and memorabilia, WCollect.com 
is primed to become the premier online destination for fine art and 
entertainment collectibles. 
 
According to Shiff, ``our affiliation with WCollect.com offers us the opportunity 
to bring our unique books and artwork to a much broader range of potential 
collectors. The Wcollect.com site also lowers our marketing and customer 
acquisition costs while placing us under a brand name that collectors can trust.'' 
The relationship is another in a series of recent high power alliances between 
traditional retail store owners, dealers and collectors. 
 
WCollect.com the a virtual online marketplace specializing in authentic 
works of art, rare and collectible books, sports and entertainment and 
memorabilia is publicly trading under the symbol WCLT on the NASDAQ 
OTC BB.
