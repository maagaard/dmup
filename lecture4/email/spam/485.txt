We can extract by country, occupation, organizations, 
associations, product, website/domain, state or megatags 
(keywords).  If we can not search and extract what 
you need, then nobody can.  No one can target your 
mailing for less.

mailings call our processing and new accounts department
at 904-282-0945, Monday - Friday.  We have been serving our 
clients since February, 1997.

Unlike other bulk mailers, you get what you pay for.  Many
other bulk mailers DO NOT send out the amount of emails
you pay, but we send 10% more than ordered.  If you want a
copy of the addresses, they can be purchased for an additional
$50.  Then if you want to follow up with another mailing, you
can do it yourself.  Or if you want us to do a 2nd mailing to
the same addresses, the cost is 1/2 of the original cost.  
Give us a call for more details.
