<fontfamily><param>Geneva</param>Dear SPM people;


This is my thought on the rational for deciding the cut-off cycle of 

high-pass filter.  Please check the sanity of the idea.


Suppose two experiments in which epoch durations are all fixed to T
sec.

	experiment 1   ABABAB

	experiment 2   ABCBACACB


The cut-off cycle of high-pass filter for experiment 1

should be 4*T, because an 'AB' makes one cycle (2*T) and 

linear combination of cosine waves above twice of this cycle surely 

pass the signal under 2*T.


But this idea can not be extended to the experiment 2, since

we can not find the explicit or apparent cycle for conditions.



Here I put my thought: the cut-off cycle of high-pass filter for 

both experiment 1 and 2 should be the four times of the epoch

duration, 4*T. If there is no consecutive exposure of the same
condition, 

the surge of the BOLD signal for a condition is expected  

like this figure. 

                   |^^^^^^^^|

           ____|        |____

              T      T       T       (duration)

This wave can not be modeled by any combination of basis functions 

over 4*T cycle, and will pass the high pass filter of 4*T.

So, regardless of the number of conditions or order of 

presentation, the cut-off cycle should be four times of one 

epoch duration.


I would appreciate any comment.

Michiru
