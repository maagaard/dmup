<BR>
Greetings,<BR>
<BR>
Hopefully, my name is still on the list.  When I first read the letter,<BR>
I thought it was some off-the-wall idea to make money.  A week<BR>
later I met again with my client to discuss the issue.  I told him<BR>
that the letter originally brought to me was not 100% legal.<BR>
I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would<BR>
be alright.<BR>
<BR>
I was curious about the letter, so he told me how it works.<BR>
I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against participating.<BR>
Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to<BR>
his results.  About two months later he called to tell me that<BR>
he had received over $800,000 in cash!!  I didn't believe him<BR>
so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself.  I thought<BR>
about it for a few days and decided that there was not much<BR>
to lose.  I followed the instructions exactly and mailed out<BR>
200 letters.  Sure enough the money started coming in!!  It<BR>
came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more<BR>
than I could open in a day.  After about three months the<BR>
money stopped coming.  I kept a precise record of my<BR>
earnings and at the end they totaled $868,439.00!<BR>
<BR>
I was earning a good living as a lawyer, but as anyone<BR>
in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress<BR>
that comes with the job.  I told myself if things worked<BR>
out I would retire from practice and play golf.  I decided<BR>
to try the letter again, but this time I sent out 500 letters.<BR>
Well, three months after that I had totaled $2,344,178.00!!<BR>
I just couldn't believe it.  I met my old client for lunch to find<BR>
out exactly how this program works.  He told me that there were a<BR>
few similar letters going around.  What made this one<BR>
different is the fact that there are seven names on the<BR>
letter, not five like most others.  This fact, alone, resulted<BR>
in more returns.  The other factor was the advice I gave<BR>
him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal,<BR>
since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal.<BR>
<BR>
I bet now you are curious about what changes I told him to<BR>
make.  Well, if you send a letter like this out, to be legal,<BR>
you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar.<BR>
I told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive<BR>
something in return.  So when you send a dollar to each<BR>
of the seven names on the list you must include a piece<BR>
of paper saying "please put me on you mailing list" and<BR>
include your name and mailing address.<BR>
<BR>
Follow these simple instructions exactly and in less<BR>
that three months you will receive over $800,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
A)  Mail a $1 bill (wrapped in a piece of blank paper) to each<BR>
of the seven names below.  Include a note (typed or handwritten<BR>
saying "Please add me to your mailing list" and include<BR>
your name and mailing address.  You MUST include this note for<BR>
this to be legal.<BR>
<BR>
1.  C. Hardy 417 Bob Plunk Rd Bethel Springs, TN 38315<BR>
2.  EST, 3535 E. Coast Highway, PMB 338, CDM, CA 92625-2404<BR>
3.  L. Lizak  P.O. Box 270 Wells, NY 12190-0270<BR>
4.  Acc. World PO Box 1108 Lewiston, NY 14092-8108<BR>
5.  M.Dunn P.O. Box 600, Byron, IL 61010<BR>
6.  J. Greenwood 9 Vail Drive, Ripley, WV 25271<BR>
7.  E.W. Sherrer, P.O. Box 270, Elk City, Id. 83525<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
B)  Remove the name next to #1 at the top of the list and<BR>
move the rest of the names up one position.  Then place your<BR>
name in the #7 spot.  This is done by saving this to a file and<BR>
the entering your information on line #7.  Be very careful when<BR>
you type the addresses and be sure to proof read them.<BR>
<BR>
C)  When you have completed the above instructions you have<BR>
an option of mailing your new letter in two ways. 1) Through US<BR>
Postal Service or 2) through e-mail. This letter has been proven<BR>
perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above<BR>
instructions, because you're purchasing membership in our<BR>
exclusive mailing list.  To mail this out over the internet, you<BR>
could browse through areas and find people to send this to<BR>
all the time.  All you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses<BR>
whenever you are on the internet.  Or you can use a Mass E-mail<BR>
Network to mail your letter in large volumes for you.  We highly<BR>
recommend this method. <BR>

<FONT color="#FF0000"> THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL!!!<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color="#000080"> (refer to title 18, section 1302 & 1342 of the U.S. Postal and Lottery<BR>
Laws).  This program is also legal in Canada.<BR>
<BR>
Assume for example, that you get 7.5% return rate, which is<BR>
very conservative.  My first attempt was about 9.5% and my<BR>
second was over 11%.<BR>
<BR>
1)  When you mail out 200 letters, 15 people will send<BR>
out $1.00<BR>
2)  Those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people<BR>
send you $1.00<BR>
3)  Those 225 mail out 200 letters and 3,375 people<BR>
send you $1.00<BR>
4)  Those 3,375 people mail out 200 letters and 50,625<BR>
send you $1.00<BR>
5)  Those 50,625 people mail out 200 letters and 759,375 people<BR>
send you $1.00<BR>
6)  Those 759,375 people mail out 200 letters and 11,390,625 people<BR>
send you $1.00<BR>
<BR>
At this point, your name drops off the list.  Think about it.<BR>
With only the first six levels, you have received over<BR>
$813,615.00!!<BR>
