In Regards to: Business Notes and Accounts Receivable


My name is Arold Joseph; I am a Business Finance Consultant. I work with
over 300 Institutional  Individual note buyers with $100 billions in
funding; because I deal with so many buyers, it enables me to negotiate the
best possible deal - it works to your advantage and the business seller. I
do not charge you a fee or commission. My fee is paid by the buyer. As soon
as I receive the information from you, I will forward it to the buyers and
get the highest possible quote on your note. It take 3 to 4 weeks to
complete the process.

What are Notes?


Notes are notes created by a sale of a business or company, lease
agreements, finance contracts, debt instruments, credit card bills, even
consumer products. In other words, any legal I.O.U.s that represents a
promise to pay over time. They provide cash flows. They are usually secured
by something of value that can be foreclosed on or claimed by the note
owner if the payments are not made. They are sold at a discount from their
balance.  

If you need cash NOW, you can factor (cash advance) your business notes.
Business Note Holders convert your seller-financed business note into cash.
If you know any business owners carrying a note, you can sell all or part
of it for cash. In addition, if someone is looking to buy a business, I may be
able to help as a Note-broker.

Can you help me locate business notes?
I will pay you a 2 percent commission of the amount a seller receives on
all business notes. The more they get - the higher your commission!!  That is
the of working with a note trader; we find you the highest bid. If your
clients are not currently providing seller-financing, I can run several
projections for your clients. 

To receive a brochure please send me your name, address and phone number to 
infoplus@mailcity.com, with the words "MORE INFO" in the subject field.  Information 
will be sent to you promptly.


Hope to be doing business with you soon!
