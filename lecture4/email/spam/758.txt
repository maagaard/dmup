Greetings from Brand Institute!

Brand Institute, inc. is the nation's largest brand naming and identity
firm.  We help corporate clients such as Procter & Gamble, Zeneca, Johnson
and Johnson, Pfizer, and Merck name their products and services, create and
maintain brand identities, and design their logos and packaging.

One of our specialties is online pharmaceutical market research on
yet-to-be-released medications. Pharmaceutical clients ask us to create
names for these products, and we in turn ask our panel of pharmacists,
physicians and nurses to help us create and evaluate these test names for
safety issues.

Our market research surveys and BrandChats (on-line brainstorming sessions)
are held at our secure website.  Target Audiences (live brainstorming
sessions) are held in local Brand Institute offices around the United
States.  Assignments vary in time and complexity, and participants are paid
accordingly.

If you are interested in participating in our Name Brand Development, please
go to our website to sign up.

1. Go to https://www.brandinst.com/secure/registration.asp?program_code=8

2. Enter your information as a pharmacist, nurse, or physician to qualify
for participation in pharmaceutical brand name development.

Thank you!
Brand Institute, Inc.

P.S.  We also conduct market research studies for consumer products.  If you
are not a health care professional, please feel free to register anyway!
