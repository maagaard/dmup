Subject: *** Wyoming Oil Lands Lottery Opens to All In November ***
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Response Required Immediately to meet the November 5th 
Closing Deadline

Hundreds of individuals will win thousands of valuable acres of 
oil and gas properties in upcoming auctions and lottery/drawings 
conducted by the government.

The object of acquiring these lands is to assign or sell them to an
 oil company having the financial and technical resources for 
exploration and development.  They pay huge cash bonuses for 
attractive parcels.  In addition as the seller, you retain overriding 
royalties on all future oil and gas production.  

These royalty revenues are ongoing.  This means you continue
 to receive an income, month after month.  These royalties can
  go on for ever and are frequently handed down from generation
 to generation - providing an income for you, your children and 
your children's children.  An income for life, so long as there is
 commercial production of oil or gas on your lease.

Because the government does not advertise nor promote this
program, the odds of winning are far greater than the usual lottery
 or sweepstakes, in many cases better than one in five! Since 
1962  hundreds of millionaires have been made and overnight 
fortunes paid in this little-known program. Now you have a unique
 opportunity to share in its wealth for a tax deductible entry fee
of just $65.00.

Our government actually owns thousands of acres of land under
 which millions of barrels of oil and billions of cubic feet of natural
 gas may exist - waiting to be discovered. This vast amount of 
acreage is divided into various tracts and parcels that are made
 available through an auction followed by a lottery/drawing process. 

While many of the parcels, ranging in size from approximately 40
 to 640 acres, have tremendous value and are indeed rich in oil
 and gas potential, the fact is most have little or no value what 
so ever. Some parcels may not be saleable at all. Thus an important
 question arises:

How to select a parcel on which to file an entry?

That's where we come in

With the help of computers we are able to analyze the vast number of 
lands offered.  We consider a number of factors prior to recommendation
 of parcels to our clients.  What is the potential value of the parcel - based
 upon prices being paid for comparable acreage in the area?  What major
 oil companies, such as Exxon, Texaco, or Standard Oil are active in the 
area?  Then finally what are the production records of oil or gas for 
neighboring parcels?

We employ the services of a staff geologist and various land men to assess
 parcels of land for final recommendation.  Then and only then are parcels
 made available for filing on behalf of our clients.  It is this level of care and
 commitment you will find in everything we do.

Here's How You can Participate - It has never been easier

If you were a large oil company assembling a team of professionals to 
compile, analyze, evaluate then select and recommend parcels on which
 to file entries would be easy.  Your company would have the financial 
resources and personnel to probably do an adequate job of providing 
recommendations of parcels on which to participate.

However as an individual, seeking to acquire a valuable interest in oil
 and gas properties, these costs become prohibitive.  Add to that the 
administrative costs of attending the auction/drawings, the travel 
expense, the costs of subscribing to the research data associated 
with knowing which of the over 400 parcels offered  are worth 
while to apply for and one can quickly see why there are so 
few individuals competing the huge number of parcels posted.

By pooling our resources and interests in these lands, Wes-State 
Properties is able to make participation, for an individual - such as 
yourself, inexpensive, easy, fun and potentially very rewarding.  
You are able to dramatically increase your odds of winning by 
selecting multiple entries on one - two - or three parcels of land 
(at handsome savings).  Additionally we keep you abreast of 
everything we do in your behalf by providing full confirmation 
of each of your entries.  If you are a winner we notify you 
immediately by telephone or telegram.

Imagine the exhilaration, thrill  and excitement of learning that you 
have just acquired an interest in an oil and gas parcel that could 
be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the potential share 
of  production that could result in overriding royalties in the million$$!

But remember - you can't win unless you enter.  Here's how to get started:

      Please Circle 1 - 2 or 3, then complete balance of information
