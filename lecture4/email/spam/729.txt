Here is how you get at least  $46,000 in $5 bills sent to your 
mailing address 
within the next 90 days:

Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major 
nightly news
program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of 
this program.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are, absolutely 
no laws
prohibiting the participation in this type of program.

This program is currently circulating through more than 50 
different
countries around the world.

There are only 4 steps:

STEP #1--------------------
Order all 5 reports shown on the list below for $5.00 each ($25.00 
total).
For each report, send $5.00 cash (wrapped in 2 sheets of paper), 
the Name 
& Number of the report you are ordering and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS.
Be sure to put your return address on your envelope in case of any 
mail problems.

STEP #2--------------------
After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and
DELETE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made 
it
through the cycle and is counting their $46,000.

Move the name and address on REPORT #4 DOWN to REPORT #5.
Move the name and address on REPORT #3 DOWN to REPORT #4.
Move the name and address on REPORT #2 DOWN to REPORT #3.
Move the name and address on REPORT #1 DOWN to REPORT #2.
Now INSERT your name/address on the REPORT #1 position.

Be sure to copy every name and address ACCURATELY!

STEP #3--------------------
Now that you have modified this letter to display your name and 
address on 
The Report #1 position, take this entire letter, and save it on 
your computer.
Make NO other changes to the instruction portion of this letter. 
Now you have 
your own master copy of this letter.

STEP#4----------
Begin E-mailing your master copy of this letter (with your name & 
address on Report #1) out to 
other Email address.  

To assist you with this, the five reports that you have purchased 
will provide you with invaluable marketing information.  They will 
tell you IN DETAIL where to go to download an assortment of FREE 
bulk E-mailing software, how to obtain FREE lists of E-mail 
addresses, and how to send 1,000,000 E-mails for FREE.


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes. 
 Let's assume that you 
Send out just 2,000 E-mails and you get only a 0.3% response while 
the other 97.7% of the recipients do absolutely nothing with this 
E-mail but delete it.  0.3% equals 6 people who have ordered 
Report #1 from you (already you have made back your initial $25 
investment and have made a profit of $5).

Now, those 6 people move YOUR name & address down to the Report #2 
position and each of those 6 people send out 2,000 E-mails (that 
totals 12,000 E-mails with your name & address on Report #2). We 
will assume again that of those 12,000 E-mails, only 0.3% of the 
recipients participate (that's a total of 36 people).

Now those 36 people each order Report #2 from you (36 people x $5 
each = $180), and move you down to Report #3.  Those 36 people 
send out 2,000 of this E-mail for a total of 72,000. The 0.3% 
response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3.

Then those 216 people send out 2,000 programs each for a 432,000 
total. The 0.3% response to that is 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. 
Those 1,296 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,592,000 total. 
The 0.3% response to that is 7,776 orders for REPORT #5.

That totals 7,776 $5 bills in your mailbox, CASH. Your total 
income in this example is $30 + $180 + $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 
for a total of $46,650.

REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING THAT 1,994 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU 
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT IGNORE AND DELETE THIS 
E-MAIL. Imagine what would happen if everyone, or even half sent 
out 100,000 of these E-mails instead of 2,000.  Many people will 
do just that and more. There are currently more than 175,000,000 
people online worldwide.

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing. You 
obviously
already have an Internet connection and E-mail is FREE.

For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is E-mail them the 
report they
ordered.  That's it.  Always provide same day service on all 
orders.

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, 
continue sending
E-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should 
receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2. If you don't, continue 
advertising or sending E-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN 
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash 
will continue to roll in.

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in 
front of a
DIFFERENT report. You can keep track of your progress by watching 
which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate 
more income, send another batch of E-mails and start the whole 
process again. There is no limit to the income you will generate 
from this business.

You are selling a product that does not cost anything to produce, 
deliver, or advertise and you are utilizing the power of the 
Internet and the power of Multilevel Marketing to distribute this 
product all over the world.  Your only expenses other than your 
initial $25 is your time.

Most people will not understand that this E-mail is just a simple 
formula written down and will dismiss this program in their mind 
as some sort of "pyramid scam" or come up with some other 
uneducated term for it.  These people have not read down this far 
and have probably already deleted this E-mail.  However, most of 
the people that DO participate in this program earn enough money 
with it that they quit their jobs in about 2-3 months.

So, imagine for a second what would happen if everyone in the 
country suddenly 
participated in this program and began making thousands and 
thousands of dollars....
they'd all quit their jobs.  The current economy and our entire 
society would completely 
fall apart.  So it is a GOOD thing for you and I that there are 
people who will
ignore this opportunity because- WE NEED those people to pump our 
gas, wash 
our cars, maintain are yards, cook & serve our food, etc.  If my 
maid were to find out
about this program, then I would have to find someone else to 
clean my house.
