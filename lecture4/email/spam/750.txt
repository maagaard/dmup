Hello,

We want to offer you our software for your web site as well as offer to help
you use it in your work.

InnerPeace is free interfaith self-help software that helps people to let go
of their issues and replace each issue with its antidotal state. It is
especially helpful with issues for which people often seek substances,
overeating, agression, and other unhealthy behaviors as "solutions."

If you would like a demonstration of InnerPeace we can arrange for a
volunteer to walk you through it. If you wish to try it on your own just
follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. Pick an issue that you
want to let go and use the process all the way through and replace the issue
with it's antidotal state.

InnerPeace could help relieve a tremendous amount of the world's suffering.
Whatever you could do to help people discover it would be appreciated. If
all you could do for now is put up a link, that would be great. If you could
do a review, an article, or any research on it, all the better. Whatever
help you could be in getting word out about it would be appreciated.

Yours in the service of peace and love,

InnerPeace Volunteers
