   The fine print:

   Gift certificates must be redeemed at The
   Passion Shoppe web site. 
  
   Gift certificates are not redeemable for cash.

   Gift certificates and unused portions of gift
   certificates expire on the date listed on the
   e-gift certificate or the earliest date
   permitted under applicable law, whichever occurs
   later.

   Any unused balance will be placed in your gift
   certificate account.

   If your order exceeds the amount of your gift
   certificate, you must pay for the balance with a
   credit card or check on TPS's e-commerce 
   secure web site or by mail with a money order.
