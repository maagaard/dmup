Find out how you can create your own chip  - and not have to debug
one that someone else has created. Register for our free seminars now at

Write the CPU to fit your code, not the code to fit your CPU.
Is there really a way of designing systems-on-chip without being tied to
conventional microprocessor architectures?

At ARC Cores we say there is. It's a case of creating your own processor
to fit your code and, at the same time, customising your data flow for
ultimate bandwidth. We appreciate that this may, in some cases, be 
difficult to believe, but we'd very much like to show you how.
Attend one of our FREE informal half-day seminars in next week. We'll help
you get a perspective on the microprocessor industry, then give you
specifics about creating a processor using the industry standard
VHDL/Verilog language. Jim Turley, formerly the microprocessor industry's
leading analyst, will be chairing the event and will be joined by a
selection of guest speakers.


In the UK the seminars will be held at:

12 October: Cambridge Garden Moat House, Cambridge
13 October:  Manchester United Football Club, Manchester
14 October:  National Motor Cycle Museum, Birmingham
15 October:  Blue Mountain Golf Centre, Bracknell

In France:

18 October:  Novotel de Massy Palaiseau, Palaiseau, Paris

In Sweden:

19 October: Ulriksdals Vardshus, Stockholm, Sweden

In Denmark

So learn how you can free your mind.  Register for one of these seminars
