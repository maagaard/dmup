My name is Carey Wilbur.  Through the responsible and intelligent
use of internet technology, I am developing a small mailing list of
business people that maintain an internet presence and currently
use or might someday use equipment leasing and financing
alternatives.   I have personally compiled a list of commercial
email addresses from the internet and yours is one that I've
collected.  I don't purchase lists from others and I don't sell my list
to anyone.

I plan to send out a short newsletter from time to time.  It will
contain details about various equipment financing options available
to businesses and will include bits and pieces of information I feel
would be interesting and useful to business people in general.

I realize that not everybody wants or likes unsolicited commercial
e-mail and not everybody is interested in what I have to provide.  I
am sensitive to this and I respect the rights of others.  Therefore, if
this message has offended you in any way please accept my sincere
apology.  If you wish to be 'removed' from my list, please hit reply
and include 'remove' in the subject line.  I will gladly and promptly
'remove' your address.

If you are interested in learning more about our company please
visit our site at www.mediacap.com.  Unfortunately it is currently
under construction and will not be fully functional until March 25,
1998.
