The Fake Money Detector (FMD) Pen is amazing and so simple to 
use!

Just a short stroke of specially formulated ink anywhere on U.S. 
(current and newly introduced $20, $50 and $100 bills) and 
international paper money, (over 145 currencies) INSTANTLY 
detects whether it is GENUINE or FAKE.

This incredible, innovative idea is the smart solution to avoid 
losing thousands of dollars to counterfeit fraud.
