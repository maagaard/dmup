Welcome!

	You are going to just LOVE our MONEYLESS Wealth Building
Club that can bring you thousands of dollars worth of .999 fine
Pure Silver 1 oz. rounds to your Postal Mail Box. You can collect
or sell them as you see fit and they may keep coming to you FOR
LIFE!

	Membership in the Silver River Gift Club is absolutely
FREE. We are a group of like minded people that believe in the
spirit of giving freely and helping others prosper. We believe
every day should be like Christmas and filled with love. If you
are of like mind you are welcome to join the Silver River Gift
Club. If not of like mind please do not join.

	NO government agency or Postal authority can interfere
with our Club, because no money is involved. Even though we use
the pyramid system to spread the word as Jesus did, we can't be
called a ponzi scheme by authorities because NO MONEY is being
transferred and NO products are being sold! 1 oz. silver rounds
NOT displaying the word dollar are NOT considered money under
the laws of the United States. Individual gifts $10,000 in value
or less are not taxable at the present time.

	We have decided to make this program a simple matrix,
Unlimited Wide X 10 (ten) Levels Deep, so Silver Rounds will
keep flowing into your mailbox for a long, long time! The amount
of WEALTH you may obtain could be astronomical!

	We have done our best to keep the program simple and
easy to replicate. Here is all you have to do. Below is a list
of up to 10 (ten) people. Just go to your local coin dealer and
get a .999 fine 1 oz. Silver Round for each person on the list.
Package it, so it is concealed and will not rattle, and mail one
Silver Round to each person on the list.

	Include with the Silver Rounds you send, the following
note:
--------------------------------------------------------------
I have just joined The Silver River Gift Club! I hope my gift,
to you, will brighten up your day! Love makes the world go
round!
--------------------------------------------------------------

Be sure to put your return address on all the GIFTS you send, 
for safe mailing.

The next job is to edit this letter according to the following
directions.

1) Remove the entry on level 10 and add your name and address
above all others, then renumber the list 1 through 10. Everyone
will have moved down one position and you will be on top, number
1 position.

2) DO NOT CHEAT! That will only hurt your efforts. Remember God
and Jesus are watching! The Lord Loves A Cheerful Giver! Jesus
said, "Cast your bread upon the water and it shall be returned
1000 fold!

3) Next be sure you alter nothing else, unless there are arrows
on the left margin, remove them carefully. Also remove old
headers. This letter is Copyrighted. NO other changes are 
authorized.

4) Send this letter to all your internet friends by email. Also
send it to every person who SPAMS you. Emailing makes promotion
of this program absolutely FREE!!!

Gift Club. (See the letter head of this letter.)
