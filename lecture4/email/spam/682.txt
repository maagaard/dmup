I recently joined a great new Internet company -- AllAdvantage.com -- that 
pays its members to surf the Web! AllAdvantage.com even pays me when 
my friends are surfing, which is why I'm sending this message to you! 

It only takes a minute to join, so sign up now (using me as your referring 
member) at  Welcome to AllAdvantage.com! and start earning cash today. 
They explain everything on the Website. It's totally free, privacy-protected, 
and the money is real! 

Happy $urfing!
