MAKE LONG DISTANCE CALLS FOR 5 CENTS A MINUTE EVERY DAY OF THE 
WEEK, AT ANY HOUR! Intrastate calls are just 9 cents. 

Also call overseas "24/7" to many countries such as England, 
France, Germany, Canada, and even Australia for just 5 cents a 
minute! 

Calls zip along a high-tech, fiber optic network, with super-fast 
switches ensuring highest quality
communications. 

Don't be seduced by heavily advertised five-cent Sunday plans 
that can charge you 25 cents a minute during weekdays. 

TRY us. You'll LOVE us. You aren't even required to dump your 
current long distance carrier. Just dial our access code. Calls 
appear on your regular phone bill. No need to write additional 
checks. 

You can choose to simply be a happy customer. Or you can also 
become an independent representative like me, and make your calls 
for as low as 4.6 cents a minute! 

I am a former corporate salesperson for WorldCom (which just 
bought MCI), and truly appreciate how wonderful this rate is. 
Don't just take my word for it: Both Money magazine and MSNBC 
have praised the value in this service. 

Call me toll-free  888-615-5809  to receive full information.
