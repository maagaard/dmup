The method Karl suggested was like this:
"The confusion is resolved by not modelling
condition effects and simply using the VF as a single covariate of
interest.  This will identify regions where the activity is predicted
by VF and implicitly regions where changes in activity correlate with
changes in VF (my emphasis).  Your parameter estimates will be more
interpretable if you remove subject effects from the VF score (by removing the
mean VF score for each subject).Previously you were modelling a condition
effect which probably accounted for the differences you were interested in.
Make sure that you model subject effects in you new model."


Steven did this:

1. mean adjust and sign change the difference psychometric score

If you have only one group, the mean-adjustment (within condition and across all 
subjects) consists of dividing by a constant (group mean), as does dividing by 
two.  I think this is unneccessary, as it would come out in the wash. If you do 
this, the differences actually have the same absolute value but opposite signs 
within each subject.  Steven then reverses the sign in all second scans, 
presumably ending up with identical (same sign) values for each subject.

2. select a "multi-subject, condition & covariates" design.

3. seek [-1] and [1] correlations for contrasts.

I think this contrast is required because the programme does not expect the 
covariates for different conditions to have opposite signs, it expects identical 
values.  The confusion probably arose, because previously we were modelling 
condition specific fits by adding another covariate of interest, such as -1 1-1 
1-1 1-1 etc., or in fact multiplied this vector with the absolute difference. In 
other words, if you put in the covariate (difference) as absolute values, the 
contrasts -1-1 and 11 give you the significance that correlations in both 
conditions together are < or > 0.  If you put in -1 1 or 1 -1, you get the test 
that correlations in both conditions are different from each other.  If you 
enter the covariate with opposite signs (as you would if you enter condition1 - 
condition2 for the first condition and condition2 - condition1 for the second 
condition) you have to reverse signs as above in order to get the same 
interpretation of contrasts.

I believe that Steve's method is correct as well, as he looks at the interaction 
between condition and differenceas a covariate, which should be equivalent to 
regressing the difference scan scores on difference psychometric scores.

As far as replications and conditions is concerned, I have the hunch that the 
former does not explicitly model the repeat measures effect, in the sense that 
you cannot call up a contrast between replications.  As far as the treatment of 
the covariate is concerned, there may be no difference between the two designs.

I wonder whether Karl can add his authoritative judgement on this?
