The Duct Tape Trick
Beautiful matching luggage may look nice in the store - but have you
ever noticed how much it looks like every other bag on the luggage
carousel?  Instead of buying new luggage for your next trip try dressing
up old luggage with bumper stickers, duct tape and twine.  You'll pick
your bags right out of the pile, baggage personnel will (hopefully)
place it gently on the carousel to keep it from popping - and you'll
have the extra money to spend on a first class upgrade or a fabulous
souvenir!
