********************************************************** 

Value Holdings, Inc. (OTCBB: VALH) is one of the most undervalued stocks
we have come across. The company has assets in excess of $18 million
and a book value of $6 million. This means that the stock is current
trading at its book value. 

But that is only part of the story. In addition to its significant
assets the company just reported revenues of $9 million for its second
fiscal quarter. Profits were $630,000. According to the company, the
majority of those revenues were earned in just two months of the quarter
following an acquisition. 

****************** 
BACKGROUND 
****************** 

Value Holdings, Inc., is in two distinct businesses: Forest Products
and Restaurants. 

Network Forest Products Limited is the company's wholly owned subsidiary
that was formed when the company acquired the assets of John Ziner
Lumber Limited in February 1999. For the second quarter ended April 30,
1999 Network Forest Products had revenues of $8.9 million. Network is a
distributor and remanufacturer of lumber based in Toronto, Canada. The
company distributes lumber to the construction industry and also
remanufacturers low grade lumber into higher grade lumber so that it is
worth more on the market. This ability allows the company to buy
cheaper lumber, remanufacture it, and then sell at a price above what it
would have sold for in its original state. 

Value Holdings, Inc., also licenses six budget seafood restaurants in
the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area. The company developed the Cami's Seafood
and Pasta restaurant concept and licensees it to third party operators
who pay the company a license fee equal to 3% of gross revenues. The
restaurants as a group gross approximately $12 million per year,
providing the company with income of about $360,000. The company is not
responsible for the day-today operations of the restuarants. 

The company is fully reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission can be
viewed at the SEC web site (www.sec.gov) in the Edgar Archives. 

************************* 
POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH 
************************* 

While not deemed to be in a "high growth" industry, Value Holdings is
expected to see continued growth in lumber and restaurant sales.
Already this year the company has shown quarter-to-quarter and
year-to-year growth in restaurant sales. Additionally, the acquisition
of the lumber assets will add an unprecedented amount of revenue and
earnings to the company. In its last fiscal year the company had actual
revenue of
about $360,000 and a loss of $2.9 million. For this fiscal year ending
October 31, 1999 we expect revenues of $45 million and net income of
more than $2.8 million. This would be a significant turn-around. This
is borne out by the current report of revenues of more than $9 million
in the fiscal second quarter and net income of $630,000 as reported on
the company's quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commision. 

Additionally, the company has seen asset growth just over the last three
months due to a significant increase in the price of lumber. The company
is also experiencing increased sales.  

The company has also announced two letters of intent that have the
potential to signifcantly increase revenues and earnings. First, the
company has announced that it entered into a letter of intent to
purchase another lumber distributor. While this distributor is also in
Ontario, it serves a different geographic area. The company also
announced that it has been approached for joint-venture to develop a
remanufacturing and pallet production facility. Thus, it is possible
that the company could see sales in the range of $75 million per year
during fiscal 2000. In addition to expansion through acquisition the
company has increased the size of its sales force and added a pine
specialist; the company had not had significant pine sales previously.

There is also great potential for an increase in restaurant income. The
company's current licensee is actively seeking to open new restaurant
locations. The opening of new locations is at no-cost to the company as
all expenses are paid by the licensee. 

******************************* 
ANALYSIS OF STOCK ACTIVITY 
******************************* 

The stock reacts very favorable to earnings announcements and other
positive news. On days when news is released the stock experiences
heavy volume and significant buying.On the recent earnings announcement
the stock saw volume in excess of 6 million shares and peaked at $0.17
on June 16, 1999 the day after the earnings announcement. Since the
earnings announcement, the price has stayed between $0.07 and
$0.09.The spreads have remained relatively tight suggesting an active
market with good liquidity. Average volume since May has been
approximately 500,000 shares per day.

There have been no filings by insiders of their intent to sell their
stock. This usually means that the insiders are sitting tight as they
expect a rise in the stock price.

PRESS RELEASES 
***************** 

The company has released the following press releases in recent weeks: 

                       Value Holdings, Inc. Reports 2nd Quarter Revenues
                           of $9,032,049 and Net Income of $630,006


June 15, 1999--Miami--Value Holdings, Inc. (OTC BB: VALH) today
announced that it has reported net income of $630,006 on revenues of
$9,032,049 for its second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 1999. The
financial information for the second quarter was disclosed in the
company’s 10-QSB filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

For the same quarter of 1998, the company posted revenues of $153,709
and a net loss of $12,615. The dramatic turnaround is the result of the
company’s acquisition of the assets of John Ziner Lumber Limited on
February 25, 1999. Lumber operations accounted for $8,923,505 in
revenues. However, lumber sales were only generated for two of the three
months during the second quarter, as the company did not acquire the
assets until the end of February. 

Income before depreciation, amortization and other charges was $929,494.
Value Holdings does not expect to have any income tax exposure as the
company has more than $12 million in carry forward losses to offset any
income tax liability. 

"We are very pleased with our results for the second quarter," said
Robert Ziner, president and CEO of Value Holdings, Inc. "Network Forest
Products Limited, our lumber subsidiary, had very strong sales for the
quarter, which we expect will continue throughout the summer building
season. Additionally, our Cami’s Seafood and Pasta restaurant group
posted quarter to quarter and year to year gains in licensing revenue." 

Value Holdings has a license agreement with a restaurant management
company which operates six Cami’s Seafood and Pasta Restaurants in South
Florida. Value Holdings receives a license fee equal to a percentage of
gross restaurant revenue. 

In addition to the increase in revenues, Value Holdings’ assets rose to
$18,458,668 from $664,635 at the end of the previous fiscal year.
Liabilities increased to approximately $12.6 million from $1.7 million
due to the acquisition of the Ziner Lumber assets.

                                Network Forest Products Receives 
                         Letter of Intent from Michipicoten First Nation

June 16, 1999--Toronto--Network Forest Products, Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Value Holdings, Inc. (OTC BB: VALH), today announced that
it has received a letter of intent from the Michipicoten First Nation
requesting a joint venture where Network will provide machinery,
financing, technical assistance and training to High Falls Lumber Ltd.,
for the creation of a pallet manufacturing and a lumber remanufacturing
facility. 

Network and the High Falls Lumber Company Ltd, which is owned by the
Michipicoten First Nation, will develop a facility in High Falls,
Ontario, that would produce wood pallets which are widely used in the
storage and transportation of a broad range of products. Pallets are
generally made of low grade lumber that cannot be used in building.
Additionally, Network and High Falls anticipate assembling a lumber
remanufacturing facility in High Falls. The remanufacturing process
allows low grade lumber to be turned into ahigher grade lumber suitable
for various uses and commanding a higherprice. This process allows for
the use of low grade lumber that would otherwise be considered waste or
for low value uses. 

"Our new relationship with the Michipicoten First Nation and High Falls
Lumber gives us a great opportunity to use the remanufacturing expertise
we have developed to provide economic development opportunities for the
Michipicoten First Nation and to more efficiently use our natural
resources," said Robert Ziner, president and CEO of Value Holdings and
Network Forest Products. "By remanufacturing lumber we can increase the
value we get from each tree and in the long run use fewer trees." 

The letter of intent calls for Network to provide machinery, financing,
technical assistance and training to High Falls Lumber. The venture
between the parties is subject to final negotiation. 

Value Holdings, Inc. is a holding company formed to acquire businesses.
The corporate goal is to build well-run independent subsidiaries which
have solid market niches with compounded growth rates in terms of
revenues and earnings.

efficiently distribute forest products in the Kitchener, Ontario area
and will significantly add to our customer base," said Robert Ziner,
President and CEO of Value Holdings, Inc. "This acquisition will
complement Network Forest Products’ current operations ." Network Forest
Products Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Value Holdings, is
located in Toronto and is a distributor and remanufacturer of lumber.
