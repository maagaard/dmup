Christmas is just 12 days away! Have you done all your shopping?

If not, I would like to suggest that you take a look at the great
selection of robot kits and toys at Robot Books.com

Why face the crowds at the mall when you can just click a button
and have your presents delivered to your door all gift-wrapped,
and ready to go!

Here are some of the best selling items featured in our 
"Robot Kits and Toys" section:

Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System
The best-selling robot kit ever.

RAD the Robot
Almost two feet tall, RAD is a high-performance, radio-controlled
robot. You control RAD to move in any direction, do 360-degree
turns, and bend at the waist to pick things up with his grasping
arms.  

Battle Drones
Take robot combat to a whole new level with these collectable,
radio-controlled battle drones.

Robot Dog
New Robot from ROBOTIX includes a wireless remote control and four
electric motors that let you command your robo-pet to move forward,
backward, turn, and open his jaw.

Remote Control Blimp
Fly it a full 50 feet away. This Radio Control Flying Blimp
Features a 51" refillable mylar helium balloon, and twin microjet
thrusters.
