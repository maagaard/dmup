Dear Science Board Member,


***Congratulations to our 20 members who each received a $25 Amazon.com
gift certificate for their participation in last month's Best on the
Web study!***


You are invited to participate in a new study entitled, "Restriction
Enzymes: What Makes the Difference?"  Restriction enzymes, or
restriction endonucleases, are essential tool in biological research. 
Numerous suppliers strive to provide researchers with high quality
enzymes that are reliable and precise in cleaving specific sequences of
DNA molecules. With so many companies to choose from, what are the key
elements of value that lead you to choose one supplier over another?


The survey consists of 17 questions and takes less than 10 minutes to
complete.  Upon completion of the survey, your account will be credited
with 50 Reward Points. In addition, one participant will be randomly
selected to receive a new PalmV personal organizer from 3Com!  Your
chance of winning this organizer is approximately 1 in 400.  In
addition, five other respondents, also chosen at random, will each
receive a $20 electronic gift certificate from Amazon.com!
