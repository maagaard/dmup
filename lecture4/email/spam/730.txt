        Analog Devices' New TigerSHARC DSP For 
           The Future Of Telecommunications

A new DSP era has begun.  Analog Devices Inc. introduces the 
ADSP-TS001, the first product in the new TigerSHARC DSP family.  The 
TigerSHARC architecture is a Static Superscalar architecture 
optimized for telecommunications infrastructure and other large-scale 
signal processing applications. The ADSP-TS001 has the capability of 
executing up to eight 16-bit instructions in a single cycle achieving 
record levels of processing performance. TigerSHARC DSP is also the 
first with native support for 8-, 16-, and 32-bit fixed-point and 
floating-point processing on the same chip. Until now, this data type 
flexibility was unavailable among DSP processors and will prove to be 
increasingly valuable in the demanding telecom and high performance 
signal processing markets. 

The ADSP-TS001 TigerSHARC DSP's key features include:
 - Eight 16-bit MACs/cycle with 40-bit accumulation
 - Two 32-bit MACs/cycle with 80-bit accumulation
 - 6 Mbit on-chip SRAM
 - Glueless multiprocessing
 - 4 link ports - 600 Mbytes/sec transfer rate
 - 64 bit external port - 600 Mbytes/sec
 - Algebraic assembly language syntax
 - Optimizing C compiler
 - VisualDSP tools support

So "turbo charge" your design with the ADSP-TS001 TigerSHARC DSP.
