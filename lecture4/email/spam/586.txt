Before I found these AMAZING products I was a heavy smoker, I had no desire to get
out of bed, and had no energy in the evening after work. I would come home from a long
day and have to take a nap just to make it threw the rest of the day. I am a health nut so I
ran once or twice a week.

Now, I bolt out of bed, spend a long day at work, come home and still have an
unbelievable amount of energy. I run and excersize three to four times a week because I
have three to four times as much energy.The best part is the stop smoking program helped
me kick the cigarette habit. I smell and feel great. 

My wife lost, after having our first son, 10 pounds in the first 2 weeks. She has lost a total
of 20 pounds and still losing.

Check these testamonials out.

	" I was an over weight, abandoned by my husband and struggling to support two
small boys on welfare and food stamps. At 238 pounds I found myself exhausted,
desperate and broke, until I met a friend who sent me some of these products. I shared
them with my mom and we both lost weight. We really love these products."

	"At 260 pounds, my doctor recommended that I lose weight. Luckily, my neighbor
was a distributor for these products. Within a week my energy level was way up. Today, I
am 60 pounds lighter and my doctor is so impressed with my results from the products, he
recommends it to other patients."

	As much as 70% of common ailments are diet-and weight-related.

	In an ideal world, we would obtain a correct balance of vitamins, minerals and
other nutrients from the food we eat. But with today's hectic lifestyles and poor eating
habits, this is often impractical, resulting in a lower level of nutrition than desirable.

	Weight problems and nutritional deficiencies are widespread in our society,
mainly due to bad eating habits such as overeating, skipping meals and yo-yo dieting.
Stress, medications, smoking, alcohol and other poor eating habits all lead to decreased
nutrients absorbtion.

	The difference with these products is our program of complete nutrition and
sustained weight management.

	"When I included these products in my daily life, I felt my strength and endurance
increase. My overall physical condition improved also. In the Karate Do World Cup
competition in May of 1993, I achieved my first goal of being placed in the top five among
competitors from 23 countries. Then, in November of 1993 I won the Gold Metal. I owe
all of this to DR. Saulo Itzcard, who introduced me to these nutritional products, and to
my husband who is my trainer."
