Save 50-95% on your international long distance phone bills!!!
Major savings on international calls from non-U.S. countries to
anywhere in the world !!!

By using state-of-the-art call-switching technology, GlobalTel
(est 1991) is able to provide these low rates to callers in every
country around the world.

Non-US rates are often three to four times higher than US rates
due to the huge taxes that monopoly telephone companies impose
on their captive customers. These high rates make it more difficult
for foreign companies to compete in the global marketplace.

GlobalTel rates are flat rates (no surcharge) , available 24 hours
a day. You save with these rates because they are low and billed
in 6 second increments after the first minute.

monthly charges.
