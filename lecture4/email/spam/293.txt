--DISCOUNTS UP TO 65% OFF AT OVER 7000 HOTELS-
TravelNow has been working with several consolidators in the hotel industry
to bring the very best hotel rates right to your desktop. Look for the red
star or green dot next to the hotel name to indicate properties that offer
"TravelNow Preferred" rates. These rates range up to 65% off the standard
room rates, and are even available for sold out dates!


--POWERFUL INTERACTIVE HOTEL MAP SEARCH
TravelNow has the only true interactive USA hotel map search on the
internet!  While other sites might show you anemic still frame maps giving
you the general location of your hotel, TravelNow maps are generated in
real-time giving your the power to find the perfect hotel geographically.
You can zoom-in, zoom-out, and pan to see the hotel distribution for an
entire city to aid you in your hotel selection. When you find a hotel in the
area of town that you are looking for, simply "select hotel", click on the
hotel to see the property descriptions and rates.  To start your interactive
map search, http://www.travelnow.com/maps


--ENHANCED CAR RESERVATION SYSTEM
TravelNow has improved our car reservation system to allow searching for and
making car reservations easier than ever.  The new system allows
reservations in over 5000 cities.  Most car rental companies listed do not
require a credit card to reserve either!  Try the improved car reservation
system at http://www.travelnow.com/cars/
