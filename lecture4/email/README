The small corpus of emails was collected and labeled by Finn Aarup Nielsen 
and prepared by Anna Szymkowiak-Have, - both from the Technical University 
of Denmark. The data set has been used in several of the writings of Anna.


With Python the emails can be read with something like:

documents = [ dict(
            email=open("conference/%d.txt" % n).read().strip(), 
            category='conference') for n in range(1,372) ]
documents.extend([ dict( 
            email=open("job/%d.txt" % n).read().strip(),
            category='job') for n in range(1,275)])
documents.extend([ dict( 
            email=open("spam/%d.txt" % n).read().strip(), 
            category='spam') for n in range(1,799) ])
