                        A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITY

                                          in

                         LEARNING AND ACTION IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY:
                       COGNITIVE, COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES

As part of an NSF award to Brown University through the IGERT program, the
Departments of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, Computer Science, and
Applied Mathematics will be hiring a Postdoctoral Research Associate.
Fellows will be scholars who have displayed significant interest and
ability in conducting collaborative interdisciplinary research in one or
more of the research areas of the program: computational and empirical
approaches to uncertainty in language, vision, action, or human reasoning.
As well as participating in collaborative research, responsibilities will
include helping to coordinate cross-departmental graduate teaching and
research as well as some teaching of interdisciplinary graduate courses.
We expect that the fellows will play an important role in creating a highly
visible presence for the IGERT program at Brown, and the interdisciplinary
activities will help unify the interdepartmental activities of the IGERT
program.

Applicants must hold a PhD in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Computer
Science, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or a related discipline, or show
evidence that the PhD will be completed before the start of the position.
Applicants should send a vita and three letters of reference to the IGERT
Postdoc Search Committee, Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,
Brown University, Box 1978, Providence, RI 02912.  Special consideration
will be given to those applicants whose research is relevant to at least
two of the participating departments. The position will begin September 1,
2000 for one year, renewable upon satisfactory  completion of duties in the
first year.  Salaries will be between $35,000 and $42,500 per year. All
materials must be received by Jan. 15, 2000, for full consideration.  Brown
University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
