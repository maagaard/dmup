Applications are invited for two anticipated research fellowships in
computational approaches to understanding the molecular nature of
cancer. One position is specifically dedicated to developing tools and
techniques for analyzing gene expression data from the National Cancer
Institute's Advanced Technology Center. The other position is more
open-ended, intended for researchers interested in any aspect of the
development and application of advanced machine learning or statistical
techniques in the molecular biology of cancer.

The positions will be in the section on Molecular Statistics and
Bioinformatics, a recently formed group under the leadership of Dr. Lawrence
Hunter.  We are machine learning researchers, statisticians, molecular
biologists and physicians working to develop computational methods to take
advantage of the rapid growth of molecular biological data about cancer,
including sequences of oncogenes, gene expression profiles of neoplastic
tissues, high throughput screening of anti-tumor compounds, and allellic
variation assays such as SNPs.  The lab has abundant computational
resources, and ready access to all NIH facilities.  Candidates should be
highly motivated, with excellent programming and writing skills, and a solid
understanding of molecular biology.  We expect to fill these positions with
post-doctoral researchers, but good candidates at more junior or more senior
levels may be accomodated. Salaries will be on the NIH scale, commensurate
with experience and area of expertise.

To apply, send a CV, one or two (p)reprints, a brief description of your
motivations and goals, and the names, email addresses and phone numbers of
at least three references to the address below.  Email is preferred, but fax
or mail applications are also acceptable.
