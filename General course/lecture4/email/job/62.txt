POST-DOC POSITIONS AVAILABLE

School of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurosciences
University of Groningen

Within the School of Behavioral and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN) of 
the University of Groningen two post-doc positions  are available. 
The successfull applicants will work in the project "Neuroimaging of 
Cognition and Emotion" (supervisor Prof. Dr. K.L. Leenders). In 
general, the aim of the project is to apply neuroimaging methods 
(PET, fMRI, multichannel EEG) to test cognitive functional models and 
to gain knowledge about the relationship between brain function and 
neurophysiology.

In particular, the first post-doc will do research on cortical reorganizations 
resulting from automation in working memory tasks. This researcher 
will be appointed within the Dept. of Experimental Psychology. The 
research of the other post-doc will concern working memory 
functioning in language processing in familial dyslexia. This 
investigator will be appointed with the Dept. of Linguistics. The 
researchers will work together and with other researchers of the 
project and the BCN.

REQUIREMENTS
Candidates should have a doctoral degree (Ph.D. or equivalent) in Experimental 
Psychology, Linguistics, Neurology or Neuroanatomy with an interest 
in fundamental research. Experience with neuroimaging and/or 
psychophysiological research is advantage. Both positions are for 2 
years and are available to start immediately.

INFORMATION
For further information or to apply for these positions, please contact 
Dr. A.A. Wijers (a.a.wijers@ppsw.rug.nl) or Dr. L.A. Stowe 
(l.a.stowe@let.rug.nl).
