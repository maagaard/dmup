The computing science department at the University of Stirling has vacancies
for two chairs (full professors) and two lecturers.  They would be very
interested in people doing research in neural networks, to join the existing
interdisciplinary group here.  The official closing date has past, but anyone
interested might still contact Prof. Ken Turner, kjt@cs.stir.ac.uk.
