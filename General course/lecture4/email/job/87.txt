The Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation in the Division of
Informatics at the University of Edinburgh welcomes applications from
suitably qualified candidates regarding PhD study.

The Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation (ANC) is part of the
newly formed Division of Informatics at the University of
Edinburgh. The Institute fosters the study of adaptive processes in
both artificial and biological systems. It encourages
interdisciplinary and collaborative work involving the traditional
disciplines of neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science,
computational science, mathematics and statistics. Many of the
information-processing tasks under study draw on a common set of
principles and mathematical techniques for their solution. Combined
study of the adaptive nature of artificial and biological systems
facilitates the many benefits accruing from treating essentially the
same problem from different perspectives.

A principal theme is the study of artificial learning systems. This
includes theoretical foundations (e.g. statistical theory, information
theory), the development of new models and algorithms, and
applications. A second principal theme is the analysis and modelling
of brain processes at all levels of organization with a particular
focus on theoretical developments which span levels. Within this
theme, research areas are broadly defined as the study of the neural
foundations of perception, cognition and action and their underlying
developmental processes. A secondary theme is the construction and
study of computational tools and methods which can support studies in
the two principal themes, such as in the analysis of brain data,
simulation of networks and parallel data mining.

The Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation has available PhD
studentships (covering the cost of fees and living expenses) as from 1
October 1999.  These are supported by the Medical Research Council and
by Microsoft Research Ltd. In addition, the Division of Informatics
receives a number of EPSRC studentships for which students wishing to
study within the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation may
be considered.
