                   OREGON GRADUATE INSTITUTE 

The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (OGI) has an
immediate opening for an outstanding student in its Electrical and
Computer Engineering Ph.D program. Full stipend and tuition will be
covered.

The student will specifically work with Professor Eric A. Wan
(http://www.ece.ogi.edu/~ericwan/) on a number of projects
relating to neural network learning and speech enhancement.

QUALIFICATIONS: The candidate should have a strong background in
signal processing with some prior knowledge of neural networks.  A
Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering is preferred.

Please send inquiries and background information to ericwan@ece.ogi.edu.


Eric A. Wan
Associate Professor, OGI

                            OGI

OGI is a young, but rapidly growing, private research institute
located in the Portland area. OGI offers Masters and PhD programs
in Computer Science and Engineering, Applied Physics, Electrical
Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Materials Science and Engineering,
and Environmental Science and Engineering.

OGI has world renowned research programs in the areas of speech systems
(Center for Spoken Language Understanding) and machine learning.
(Center for Information Technologies).

Center for Spoken Language Understanding

The Center for Spoken Language Understanding is a multidisciplinary
academic organization that focuses on basic research in spoken
language systems technologies, training of new investigators, and
development of tools and resources for free distribution to the
research and education community. Areas of specific interest include
speech recognition, natural language understanding, text-to-speech
synthesis, speech enhancement in noisy conditions, and modeling of
human dialogue. A key activity is the ongoing development of the CSLU
Toolkit, a comprehensive software platform for learning about,
researching, and developing spoken dialog systems and new
applications.

Center for Information Technologies

The Center for Information Technologies supports development of
powerful, robust, and reliable information processing techniques by
incorporating human strategies and constraints. Such techniques are
critical building blocks of multimodal communication systems,
decision support systems, and human-machine interfaces. The CIT
approach is based on emulating relevant human information processing
capabilities and extending them to a variety of complex tasks. The
approach requires expertise in nonlinear and adaptive signal
processing (e.g., neural networks), statistical computation,
decision analysis, and modeling of human information processing.
Correspondingly, CIT research areas include perceptual
characterization of speech and images, prediction, robust signal
processing, rapid adaptation to changing environments, nonlinear
signal representation, integration of information from several
sources, and integration of prior knowledge with adaptation.
