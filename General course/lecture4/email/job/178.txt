Postdoc position available for Alzheimer study with the use
of neuro-imaging (PET/MRI) techniques.

We invite applications for a postdoctoral research fellow with a joint
position in the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science. The
position, which is funded under the Computerized Brain Imaging Project in
conjunction with the Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, is open
immediately and is initially funded until June 30, 2000.  Extension of the
appointment is contingent on renewed funding.

The successful candidate will collaborate with a research team of faculty and
graduate students from the departments of Computer Science and Mathematics on
the development of high performance serial and parallel numerical algorithms
for neuro-imaging studies.

All candidates must have a recent doctoral degree in mathematics, computer
science, computational science, or closely related area with an emphasis in
computational mathematics and evidence of strong proficiency in high-level
programming in a Unix environment.  Experience in the design and
implementation of algorithms for image deformation, segmentation or other
specialized image-processing applications for bio-medical imaging studies is
desired. Familiarity with parallel algorithms and architectures as well as a
strong working knowledge of C and/or Fortran is also desirable.

Additional information about this position can be obtained by contacting
Professor Renaut, renaut@asu.edu, Professor Farin, farin@asu.edu or Professor
Chen, kchen@IMAP1.ASU.EDU.

Applicants must send their full curriculum vita including a list of
publications, a list of three referees and a statement addressing their
research interests and agenda to:
     Computational Math Postdoctoral Fellow
     Attn :  Professor Rosemary Renaut, Chair
     Department of Mathematics
     Box 871804
     Arizona State University
     Tempe, AZ 85287-1804

Application Deadline: Review of the applications will begin on September 1,
1999 and will continue weekly until the position is filled.
AA/EOE.
