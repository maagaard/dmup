NEURAL CORRELATES OF ASSOCIATIVE CONDITIONING IN HUMANS AND RODENTS

Profs.  David Anderson and  Christof Koch at the California Institute
of   Technology  in   Southern   California  are   looking  for   two
post-doctoral fellows  for a period up  to three years to  work on the
neural basis  of classical  associative conditioning in  humans (using
behavioral  measures and  functional  MRI brain  imaging) and  rodents
(using similar behavioral  paradigms, coupled with pharmacological and
molecular  lesioning  techniques).   One  fellow, based  in  the  Koch
laboratory,  should  have a  background  in  human  sensory or  memory
psychophysics,  or fMRI  studies.  The  other, based  in  the Anderson
laboratory,   should   have   a   background  in   rodent   behavioral
neuroscience,  preferably with  some experience  in neuropharmacology,
anatomy or lesioning studies.

The start  time is negotiable,  but can be immediately.   Salary level
will depend upon the applicant's  experience, but will be no less than
$26,000 per year.  The California  Institute of Technology is an equal
opportunity employer.

To apply,  please send a vita  containing a brief  summary of research
experience.  Please include the names of at least two references.
