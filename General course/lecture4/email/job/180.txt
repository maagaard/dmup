Research Position (cognitive/computational neuroscience)

A position (beginning Nov 1999, 2 years, 1 year extension possible) 
is available at the University of Ulm in an interdiscplinary research 
project on analysis and modeling of functional magnetic resonance data.   
In this joint project of the departments of Psychiatry, Radiology and 
Neural Information Processing a method of detection and interpretation 
of functional/effective connectivity in fMRI data will be developed 
and will be applied to working memory tasks. 

Candidates should have a background in statistical methods, functional 
MRI analysis or computational neuroscience. Required is a recent masters 
degree or equivalent in computer science, physics, mathematics or in a 
closely related area. The research can be conducted as part of a PhD 
thesis degree in Computer Science. Experience in programming in C in a 
Unix environment is necessary, experience with MATLAB and SPM is helpful. 

Salary according to BAT IIa. The University of Ulm is an equal opportunity 
employer and emphatically encourages female scientists to apply. Employment 
will be effected through the "Zentrale Universitaetsverwaltung" of the 
University of Ulm.

Please send CV, letter of motivation and addresses of three referees to: 
Prof. Dr. Dr. M. Spitzer, Department of Psychiatry III, 
University of Ulm, Leimgrubenweg 12, 89075 Ulm, Germany 
or e-mail to manfred.spitzer@medizin.uni-ulm.de.
