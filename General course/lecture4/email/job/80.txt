NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CLINICAL SCIENTIST

The Kunin-Lunenfeld Applied Research Unit of Baycrest Centre for
Geriatric Care invites applications for a neuropsychiatric scientist
position.  The successful candidate will engage in an interdisciplinary
clinical research program in the Department of Psychiatry.  The person
will work closely with clinician researchers, basic neuroscientists and
the program in neuropsychiatry at the Rotman Research Institute and at
the University of Toronto.  The position will involve an emphasis on the
neurobehavioural underpinnings of late life mood disorders with
opportunity for collaboration in functional neuroimaging.

The candidate must have an MD plus at least a research Master’s, or a
Ph.D. (or equivalent) in a related field.  The candidate will be
eligible for a cross appointment at the University of Toronto at the
Assistant or Associate professor level. Clinical investigators
(psychiatrists, neurologists, neuropsychologists, etc.) with an interest
in the neurology of behaviour are especially encouraged to apply.

The KLARU of Baycrest Centre is the clinical arm of its Research
division. The mission of the KLARU is to improve clinical care by
conducting research which evaluates clinical practice, integrates
advances in basic sciences with current clinical practice, and
determines the prevalence of disorders in the community and at
Baycrest.  Research initiatives and programs are designed to enhance the
quality of care and life of the elderly.  Such research functions at the
interface between basic and applied science and involves both the
evaluations of the validity of current treatment programs and the
development of new management and treatment procedures.

Baycrest Centre and the University of Toronto encourage applications
from qualified individuals, members of visible minorities, aboriginal
people and persons with disabilities.

Position available immediately, and will remain open until filled.
Applicants should submit a covering letter describing current research
interests and future research goals, a complete C.V. relevant reprints
