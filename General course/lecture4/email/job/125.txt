 	We are currently looking for a full-time research assistant/lab
manager to work from now until at least July, 2000.
	The Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, directed by John Jonides
and Edward E. Smith, focuses on brain imaging (PET and fMRI) studies of
memory in young and older adults.  The laboratory is part of the
University of Michigan Department of Psychology and is affiliated with the
University of Michigan Medical Center.  Lab members come from a variety of
backgrounds -- psychology, medicine, statistics, and physics.
	Responsibilities will include running behavioral and neuroimaging
experiments, data processing and analysis, subject recruitment and the
coordination of ongoing experiments, including some supervision of
undergraduate assistants.
	Familiarity with basic word processing and spreadsheet
applications is a must, basic programming skills and knowledge of UNIX,
Matlab, SPM, and PsyScope is highly desirable (but not a necessity).
	This is a terrific opportunity to gain exposure to the field of
cognitive neuroscience, and to work in a dynamic, productive laboratory.
This job is an ideal springboard for recent college graduates who are
interested in obtaining an advanced degree in any discipline related to
cognitive neuroscience.

Please send a resume, reference contact information, and, if possible,
college transcripts to:

Christy Marshuetz
Department of Psychology - C&P
The University of Michigan
525 East University St.
Ann Arbor, MI  48104
