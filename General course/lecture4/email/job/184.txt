The Robotics neuro-group at the German Aerospace Center in
Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, has three Ph.D. position openings on the
following subjects:

* Learning changing environments in large neural networks 
* Multiresolution neural networks for fast and accurate learning 
* Active vision using statistical inference neural networks 

Visit http://www.robotic.dlr.de/LEARNING/jobs/ for more information.


Condensed versions of these job descriptions follow:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning changing environments in large neural networks

Goal of this research project is the exploration and development of
learning methodologies (optimization) for large-scale neural networks.
Secondly, the effect of incremental learning in such networks is to be
investigated. Close cooperation with the vision and DLR
Four-Finger-Hand groups in our department are important in the
development and application of the methodologies.

We are looking for a candidate to join our currently expanding
neuro-group in the DLR Robotics Department in Oberpfaffenhofen,
Germany. The desired candidate has a strong background in mathematics
as well as statistics, and knows her way around programming in C++ and
Mathematica.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiresolution neural networks for fast and accurate learning

Goal of this Ph.D. research is the further development of a
multiresolution approximation method in the application of on-line
learning of high-dimensional data, using MARS as well as the Nested
Network as a starting-point.  An important issue is the applicability
to high-dimensional problems.  The theoretical and implementational
aspects of this projects are of equal importance; as a result, the
algorithm should be implemented as a real-time shape-from-shading task,
as dynamics control in complex hand-eye coordination tasks, and for
learning data resulting from grasping tasks using the DLR
Four-Finger-Hand, which is developed and available in the DLR Robotics
group.

For pursuing research in this area we are looking for an oudstanding
qualifying candidate to join or currently expanding neuro-group in the
DLR Robotics Department in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The research
project has a major computer science component; therefore, the
applicant ideally comes from a CS background, while having a strong
foothold in statistics.  Knowledge of function approximation with
neural networks are a plus.  Prerequisite is comfortability with a UNIX
environment and knowledge of C++.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Active Vision using statistical inference neural networks

The goal of this Ph.D. research is to develop a methodology based on
statistical inference neural networks, which can be used in active
vision control. The theoretical and implementational aspects are of
equal importance; in the end, a system should result which can be used
on the DLR Four-Finger-Hand in combination with the DLR Light-Weight
robot, both of which are developed and available in the DLR Robotics
Department. The resulting system should eventually cooperate with a
grasping methodology which is currently in development.

For pursuing research in this exciting field we are looking for an
outstanding candidate to join our currently expanding neuro-group in
the DLR Robotics Department in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. In-depth
knowledge and practice in applied mathematics and strong programming
skills are mandatory.  Experience is expected in at least one of the
following areas:

   * statistical modeling, statistical inference
   * data mining
   * artificial neural networks/machine learning
   * image processing
