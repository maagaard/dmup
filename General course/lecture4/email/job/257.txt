NIMH SUPPORTED FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP

COGNITIVE NEUROIMAGING OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING LABORATORY, WEILL MEDICAL COLLEGE OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY

An NIMH grant for training clinical researchers in the cognitive
neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders provides fellowship support for an MD
or MD-PhD, preferably with psychiatry or neurology training, with serious
intent for a research career.  Prior imaging, and cognitive or basic
neuroscience experience is useful.  Training is centered around 2 years of
intensive, mentored involvement in a research project.  Training also
involves a curriculum covering the following topics in the context of
neuropsychiatric functional neuroimaging: principles of neuropsychiatry and
behavioral neuroscience, hypothesis generation and study design,
development of cognitive probes, physics of image acquisition, mathematics
and statistics of image processing and analysis, and interpretation of
results.  Projects include 1.5 and 3T fMRI studies of neural circuits
underlying symptom formation in schizophrenia, affective disorders and
anxiety disorders.  Mentors include Drs. David Silbersweig, Emily Stern,
Yihong Yang and Hong Pan in the Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory.  Dr.
Michael Posner is also involved in the training program.

Applications submitted by Feb. 10 should include a CV, three reference
letters and a letter indicating interests relevant to the grant.  Send
application to:
