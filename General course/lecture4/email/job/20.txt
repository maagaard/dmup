------ Scientist/RA position in learning/information retrieval -------

The NEC Research Institute has an immediate opening for a
Scientist/Research Associate in the area of learning and/or
information retrieval. NEC Research Institute is a basic research
laboratory located in Princeton, NJ, a short drive from Princeton
University. For more information, see http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/

This research focuses on basic issues in learning and information
retrieval and dissemination, with an emphasis on the World Wide Web. A
sample of recent research publications includes:

S. Lawrence, C.L. Giles, Searching the World Wide Web, Science, 280,
p. 98. 1998.

S. Lawrence, C.L. Giles, Context and Page Analysis for Improved Web
Search, IEEE Internet Computing, Volume 2, Number 4, pp. 38-46, 1998.

C.L. Giles, K. Bollacker, S. Lawrence, CiteSeer: An Automatic Citation
Indexing System, The 3rd ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 89-98, 
1998 [shortlisted for best paper award].

S. Lawrence, C.L. Giles, A.C. Tsoi, A.D. Back, Face Recognition: A
Convolutional Neural Network Approach, IEEE Transactions on Neural
Networks, 8, 1, pp. 98-113, 1997.

S. Lawrence, A.D. Back, A.C. Tsoi, C.L. Giles, On the Distribution of
Performance from Multiple Neural Network Trials, IEEE Transactions on
Neural Networks, 8, 6, pp. 1507-1517, 1997.

Candidates must have experience in research and be able to effectively
communicate research results through publications. Successful
candidates will have experience with information retrieval and/or
machine learning (e.g. neural networks). Proficiency with Unix/Linux
and the software implementation of algorithms is a must. Tasks will
also involve code maintenance, modification and enhancement as
required by the research program.

The Institute provides an outstanding research environment with many
recognized experts and excellent resources plus a competitive salary
and a strong emphasis on open publication of results. The successful
candidate will combine a genuine desire to excel in research with the
above attributes.

Interested applicants should send their resumes with names of
references by email, mail or fax to:
