Status: RO
X-Status: 

A postdocotral position is available starting immediately for someone
interested in pursuing computational modeling approaches to the role
of neuromodulation and/or prefrontal cortical function in cognition.
The nature of the position is flexible, depending upon the
individual's interest and expertise.  Approaches can be focused at the
neurobiological level (e.g., modeling detailed physiological
characteristics of neuromodulatory systems, such as locus coeruleus
and/or dopaminergic nuclei, or the circuitry of prefrontal cortex), or
at the more systems/cognitive level (e.g., the nature of
representations and/or the mechanisms involved in active maintenance
of information within prefrontal cortex, and their role in working
memory).  The primary requirement for the position is a Ph.D. in the
cognitive, computational, or neurosciences, and extensive experience
with computational modeling work, either at the PDP/connectionist or
detailed biophysical level.

The postdoc is funded from a collaborative research grant involving
Jonathan Cohen at the Department of Psychology and Center for the
Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior at Princeton University
(http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu/ncc/jdc.html) and the Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh, and Randall
O'Reilly at the Department of Psychology and Institute for Cognitive
Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder
(http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly).  Further information about the
resources and affiliated faculty at the possible sponsoring
institutions and programs is available at:
http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu, http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu,
http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/postdoc.html.

Interested individuals should send a curriculum vitae, representative
publications, a statement of research interests, and three letters of
reference via email to jdc@princeton.edu (please begin subject with
the words ``Modeling Position'') or via snail mail to Jonathan
D. Cohen, Department of Psychology, Green Hall, Princeton University,
Princeton, NJ 08544.  We will begin reviewing applications as they are
received, continuing until the position is filled.  Princeton
University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of
Colorado are all equal opportunity employers; minorities and women are
encouraged to apply.
