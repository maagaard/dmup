Postgraduate Studentship in Neuromorphic Engineering


An opportunity exists for a studentship in the broad area of
neuroinformatics and sensory information processing. A wide range of 
possible research topics will be considered relating to artificial 
and biological olfaction (smell) including but not limited to: 
optical chemical sensing for artificial olfaction, sign processing 
for chemical sensor arrays using classical or neuromorphic pattern 
recognition approaches, discrete electronic or silicon 
implementations of neurones for sensory processing, and/or data 
processing of electrophysiological data from the biologic olfactory 
bulb in order to investigate the coding of odour information. 

The successful candidate will obtain an upper second class honours 
degree or better in a relevant discipline, including all areas of 
engineering, computer science, mathematics, chemistry, physics or 
biology. Computer literacy and evidence of mathematical ability will 
be seen as a distinct advantage. The award will includ full-time fees 
for higher degree registration and a maintenance grant of 8,000 
pounds sterling p.a. for which students may be required to contribute 
to laboratory demonstration within the department (up to a maximum of 
6 hours/week).

For further details and informal discussions contact Dr. Tim Pearce, 
Tel: +44 (0) 116 223 1290, E-mail: t.c.pearce@le.ac.uk. Those 
interested should submit a CV and single page statement of potential 
research interests to Dr. Tim C. Pearce, Department of Engineering, 
University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 H, United 
Kingdom. In order to guarantee consideration, applications should be 
submitted by June 18th, 1999, although the studentship will remain 
open until a suitable candidate has been found.

The University of Leicester is an equal opportunities employer. 

  Regards,

  Tim.
