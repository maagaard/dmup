Description of the CNS Department:

The Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems (CNS) provides advanced
training and research experience for graduate students interested in
the neural and computational principles, mechanisms, and
architectures that underlie human and animal behavior, and the
application of neural network architectures to the solution of
outstanding technological problems. Students are trained in a broad
range of areas concerning computational neuroscience, cognitive
science, and neuromorphic systems, including the brain mechanisms of
vision and visual object recognition; audition, speech, and language
understanding; recognition, learning, categorization, and long-term
memory; cognitive information processing; self-organization and
development; navigation, planning, and spatial orientation;
cooperative and competitive network dynamics and short-term memory;
reinforcement and motivation; attention; adaptive sensory-motor
control and robotics; biological rhythms; consciousness; mental
disorders; and the mathematical and computational methods needed to
support advanced modeling research and applications. The CNS
Department awards MA, PhD, and BA/MA degrees.

The CNS Department embodies a number of unique features. It has
developed a curriculum that consists of eighteen interdisciplinary
graduate courses, each of which integrates the psychological,
neurobiological, mathematical, and computational information needed
to theoretically investigate fundamental issues concerning mind and
brain processes and the applications of neural networks to
technology. Additional advanced courses, including research
apprenticeship and seminar courses, are also offered. Each course is
typically taught once a week in the afternoon or evening to make the
program available to qualified students, including working
professionals, throughout the Boston area. Students develop a
coherent area of expertise by designing a program that includes
courses in areas such as biology, computer science, engineering,
mathematics, and psychology, in addition to courses in the CNS
curriculum.

The CNS Department interacts with colleagues in several Boston
University research centers or groups, and with Boston-area
scientists collaborating with these centers. The unit most closely
linked to the department is the Center for Adaptive Systems.
Students interested in neural network hardware can work with
researchers in CNS, at the College of Engineering, and at M.I.T.
Lincoln Laboratory. Other research resources include distinguished
research groups in neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, and neuropharmacology
across the Boston University Charles River Campus and Medical School;
in sensory robotics, biomedical engineering, computer and systems
engineering, and neuromuscular research within the College of
Engineering; in dynamical systems within the Mathematics Department;
in theoretical computer science within the Computer Science
Department; and in biophysics and computational physics within the
Physics Department. Key colleagues in these units hold appointments
in CNS.

In addition to its basic research and training program, the
department conducts a seminar series, as well as conferences and
symposia, which bring together distinguished scientists from both
experimental, theoretical, and applied disciplines.

The department is housed in its own new four-story building which
includes ample space for faculty and student offices and laboratories
(computational neuroscience, visual psychophysics, psychoacoustics,
speech and language, sensory-motor control, neurobotics, computer
vision), as well as an auditorium, classroom and seminar rooms, a
library, and a faculty-student lounge. The department has a powerful
computer network for carrying out large-scale simulations of
behavioral and brain models.

Below are listed departmental faculty, courses and labs.

CNS students also take a wide variety of courses in related departments.
In addition, students participate in a weekly colloquium series, an informal
lecture series, and student-run special interest groups, and attend lectures
and meetings throughout the Boston area; and advanced students work in small
research groups.


LABORATORY AND COMPUTER FACILITIES

The department is funded by fellowships, grants, and contracts from
federal agencies and private foundations that support research in
life sciences, mathematics, artificial intelligence, and engineering.
Facilities include laboratories for experimental research and
computational modeling in visual perception; audition, speech and
language processing; and sensory-motor control and robotics. Data
analysis and numerical simulations are carried out on a state-of-the-art
computer network comprised of Sun workstations, Silicon Graphics
workstations, Macintoshes, and PCs. A PC farm running Linix operating
systems is available as a distributed computational environment.
All students have access to PCs or UNIX workstation consoles, a network
of SGI machines, and standard modeling and mathematical simulation
packages such as Mathematica, VisSim, Khoros, and Matlab.

The department maintains a core collection of books and journals, and
has access both to the Boston University libraries and to the many
other collections of the Boston Library Consortium.

In addition, several specialized facilities and software are
available for use. These include:

Computer Vision/Computational Neuroscience Laboratory
The Computer Vision/Computational Neuroscience Lab is comprised of an
electronics workshop, including a surface-mount workstation, PCD
fabrication tools, and an Alterra EPLD design system; a light machine
shop; an active vision lab including actuators and video hardware;
and systems for computer aided neuroanatomy and application of
computer graphics and image processing to brain sections and MRI
images.

Neurobotics Laboratory
The Neurobotics Lab utilizes wheeled mobile robots to study potential
applications of neural networks in several areas, including adaptive
dynamics and kinematics, obstacle avoidance, path planning and
navigation, visual object recognition, and conditioning and
motivation. The lab currently has three Pioneer robots equipped with
sonar and visual sensors; one B-14 robot with a moveable camera,
sonars, infrared, and bump sensors; and two Khepera miniature robots
with infrared proximity detectors.

Psychoacoustics Laboratory
The Psychoacoustics Lab houses a newly installed, 8 ft. % 8 ft.
sound-proof booth. The laboratory is  extensively equipped to perform
both traditional psychoacoustic experiments and experiments using
interactive auditory virtual-reality stimuli. The major equipment
dedicated to the psychoacoustics laboratory includes two
Pentium-based personal computers; two Power-PC-based Macintosh
computers; a 50-MHz array processor capable of generating auditory
stimuli in real time; programmable attenuators; analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters; a real-time head tracking system; a
special-purpose, signal-processing hardware system capable of
generating "spatialized" stereo auditory signals in real time; a
two-channel oscilloscope; a two-channel spectrum analyzer; various
cables, headphones, and other miscellaneous electronics equipment;
and software for signal generation, experimental control, data
analysis, and word processing.

Sensory-Motor Control Laboratory
The Sensory-Motor Control Lab supports experimental studies of motor
kinematics. An infrared WatSmart system allows measurement of
large-scale movements, and a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet
allows studies of handwriting and other fine-scale movements.
Equipment includes a 40-inch monitor that allows computer display of
animations generated by an SGI workstation or a Pentium Pro (Windows
NT) workstation. A second major component is a helmet-mounted,
video-based, eye-head tracking system (ISCAN Corp, 1997). The
latter's camera samples eye position at 240Hz and also allows
reconstruction of what subjects are attending to as they freely scan
a scene under normal lighting. Thus the system affords a wide range
of visuo-motor studies.

Speech and Language Laboratory
The Speech and Language Lab includes facilities for analog-to-digital
and digital-to-analog software conversion. Ariel equipment allows
reliable synthesis and playback of speech waveforms. An Entropic
signal processing package provides facilities for detailed analysis,
filtering, spectral construction, and formant tracking of the speech
waveform. Various large databases, such as TIMIT and TIdigits, are
available for testing algorithms of speech recognition.  For high
speed processing, supercomputer facilities speed filtering and data
analysis.

Visual Psychophysics Laboratory
The Visual Psychophysics Lab occupies an 800-square-foot suite,
including three dedicated rooms for data collection, and houses a
variety of computer controlled display platforms, including Silicon
Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx RE2, SGI Indigo2 High Impact, SGI Indigo2
Extreme, Power Computing (Macintosh compatible) PowerTower Pro 225,
and Macintosh 7100/66 workstations. Ancillary resources for visual
psychophysics include a computer-controlled video camera, stereo
viewing glasses, prisms, a photometer, and a variety of
display-generation, data-collection, and data-analysis software.

Affiliated Laboratories
Affiliated CAS/CNS faculty have additional laboratories ranging from
visual and auditory psychophysics and neurophysiology, anatomy, and
neuropsychology to engineering and chip design. These facilities are
used in the context of faculty/student collaborations.
