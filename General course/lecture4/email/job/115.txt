Post-Doctoral Fellow in Wavelets-Based Timeseries Analysis

Computer Engineering Laboratory
School of Electrical and Information Engineering
The University of Sydney, Australia

Applications are invited for Post-doctoral fellow position funded by an
Australian Research Council project grant and in collaboration with an
financial engineering company. The two-year project aims at investigating
wavelets preprocessing techniques and their applications to timeseries
analysis and compression. 

Applicants would have completed (or about to complete) their PhD in
electrical, computer or related engineering or science discipline and have
demonstrated research capacity in the area of timeseries analysis, machine
learning or related field. The fellow will be expected to work
independently and to play a leading role in the project co-supervising
postgraduate students contributing to the project. Knowledge of computational
techniques in the neural computing area, and their implementation in
software are advantages.

Appointment will be made initially for a period of one year, and renewable
for another year subject to progress. Expected starting date in June,
1999.

Closing date:		21 May 1999
Salary range:		A$ 41,620 - A$ 46,017
