Hello,

The department of computer science and operations research of
the University of Montreal is opening two tenure-track
faculty positions, and one of the main areas of interest is
that of machine learning. Note that this is a French-speaking
university and candidates are expected to be able to teach in
French within about a year of hiring (in the past we have hired several
non-francophones, and many non-Canadians, who have successfully adapted).
Note also that Montreal is a great (bilingual English/French) city
to live in, with the flavor of a European city, a vibrant cultural
life, four universities, nearby ski slopes, great and inexpensive
restaurants, and a strong network of research centers in the
mathematical sciences.

Please don't hesitate to contact me for further information.

departments in Canada as well as one of  the most active in research. Research
interests of current faculty include computational biology, telecommunications,
intelligent tutoring systems, computer architecture, software engineering,
artificial intelligence, computational linguistic, computer graphics and vision,
machine learning, theoretical and quantum computing, parallelism, optimization,
heuristics, numerical simulation. Further information can be obtained at the
Department's web site: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca.

Requirements :  Ph.D. in Computer Science or a related area. Ability to teach and
                supervise students in French within one year.
Salary :        Salary is competitive and fringe benefits are excellent.

Hardcopy applications including a curriculum vitae, a statement of current
research program, at least three letters of reference, and up to three selected
preprints/reprints, should be sent to:

Sang Nguyen, professeur et directeur
Département d'informatique et de recherche opérationnelle, FAS
Université de Montréal
C.P. 6128, Succ. "Centre-Ville"
