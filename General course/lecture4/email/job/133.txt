Research Assistant in Functional Decomposition and Analysis of Brain Activity
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD, UK.

Applications are invited for a research assistant, to commence before
October 1st 1999 (the contract will end on May 31st 2002).

The successful candidate should have a solid theoretical background from a
numerate discipline (e.g. mathematics, control engineering). We would also
consider candidates from other backgrounds with experience of image
analysis/signal processing.  Post-doctoral candidates are preferred, but
graduates with appropriate skills will also be
considered.

The research assistant will work with Dr John Porrill and Dr Jim Stone,
developing and applying novel techniques for analysis of brain activity
using data obtained from fMRI,
optical imaging and EEG. The candidate will also have the opportunity to
design and run
fMRI/EEG experiments.

This research is funded as one component of a co-operative MRC award,
and will involve collaboration with other groups working on fMRI and
optical imaging techniques.  The salary is up to 21,815 pounds (RA1A
scale, point 11) according to experience.

This interdisciplinary project is shared between the Departments of
Psychology and Clinical Neurology. The project is based in the
Department of Psychology, which is one of the leading research centres
for psychology in the UK, and has a rapidly expanding research base in
imaging technologies. This is reflected in the top ratings (currently
Grade 5A) achieved by the department in all four national research
assessment exercises.

Applicants should send a CV and a brief statement of research
interests by regular mail or email to be sent to:

Dr JV Stone, Psychology Department, Sheffield University, Sheffield, S10
2TP, UK.

Informal enquiries can be made via email to:
          {j.porrill}{j.v.stone}@Sheffield.ac.uk
