The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and The State University of New York
at Stony Brook:  SICN Fellowships for Interdisciplinary Research in
Neuroscience

The Swartz Initiative for Computational Neuroscience (SICN) announces
a program to promote collaborative studies between researchers in
computational neuroscience, mathematics, physics, engineering and
computer sciences. The goal is to understand the algorithms and
implementations that underlie brain functions. To this end, SICN
intends to foster the growth of interdisciplinary research in brain
theory. SUNY at Stony Brook has strong departments in neurobiology,
mathematics, physical sciences and technology. CSHL had a strong
program in cellular neurobiology and has made a growing commitment in
theoretical neuroscience. Scientists will be be hired at the
post-doctoral level to work in association with faculty or, if deemed
appropriate, independently. The salary will be highly competitive and
those selected will be eligible for cintinuing support from SICN.
Candidates should submit (to Jonathan Wallach at the address below) a
one-page summary of their research interests and goals, a CV, and the
names of three academic references. For full consideration,
applications should be received by October 15th, 1999.
