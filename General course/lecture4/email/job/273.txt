POSITION: MR Physics Postdoctoral Fellow

The Radiology Department of the Medical University of South Carolina in
Charleston is looking for a second postdoctoral fellow in MR physics.  The
Department has a 1.5T Picker EDGE and a 1.5T GE Signa MR scanner.  Both 1H
and 31P spectroscopy are available.  The 1.5T Picker EDGE has single-shot
EPI capability and is equipped with a multichannel stimulation/monitoring
system for "functional" imaging.  A third 1.5T system with single-shot EPI
capability has been purchased (Philips NT) and will be similarly equipped
for "interactive" functional imaging.  A dedicated MR lab has four(4) Sun
SPARCstations, a DEC ALPHA and multiple Macintosh computers available for
image/spectra processing.   

Projects involve MR physics and/or data analysis related to MR image- and
spectroscopy-based determinations of brain function. These include studies
of diffusion, perfusion, and quantitative flow/motion as well as clinical
1H and 31P spectroscopy, as part of an expanding "functional"
neuroimaging collaboration with MUSC's Institute of Psychiatry.  The
individual would be expected to help with an NIH funded study in which
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is combined with fMRI to stimulate
and simultaneously monitor brain response. There is a good possibility of
this position leading to a junior faculty position.

Charleston, located on the South Carolina coast, is one of America's
oldest cities.  Its charming historic town center is a popular tourist
stop with activities throughout the year made accessible by the city's
relatively small size.

Interested persons should send a CV and a letter describing their research
interests to the above address. The Medical University of South Carolina
is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
