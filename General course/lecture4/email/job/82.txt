Dear Colleagues,

I have a Research Studentship available here in London, UK, to work on
waste pipe inspection involving research on sensors and neural networks.

Details are attached. If you know of anyone interested please feel free
to pass this information on.

Best regards,

Kaspar Althoefer.

                           Research Studentship

                  A MULTI-SENSOR SYSTEM FOR SEWER INSPECTION

                          A Collaborative Project with
              North West Water, Water Research Centre and Telespec Ltd.
                            sponsored by the EPSRC


A research studentship is available in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering as a result of a recently awarded grant by the EPSRC. The
Department was awarded the top rating, 5*, in the 1996 Research
Assessment Exercise and excellent facilities for both computational and
experimental research are available. The project is co-sponsored by
North West Water, the Water Research Centre (WRc) and Telespec Ltd.

The three-year project involves the development of a novel sensor device
for the inspection of waste pipes and the classification of the acquired
sensor data. Applications are welcome from candidates with an interest
to pursue research in the areas of sensors, digital signal processing
and neural networks.

Applicants will preferably hold, or expect to obtain, a good first or
higher degree in mechanical engineering, electronic engineering or a
related subject, and will have programming ability. Applicants will be
expected to register for research studies leading to the MPhil/PhD
degree.

The studentship covers tuition fees at U.K./E.U. student rate and an
annual maintenance allowance of £ 8,482 for three years.

Applications in the form of a curriculum vita with the names of two
academic referees must be sent to:

Ms Nicola Nayler, Ref: EPSRC/KAA, Division of Engineering, King’s
College London, Strand, London WC2R 2LS, e-mail:
Nicola.Nayler@kcl.ac.uk.

All applications must be received by 15 April 1999.


Informal enquiries can be made to Dr Kaspar Althoefer at the address
