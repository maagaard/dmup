                Position for a Ph.D. student in

             Evolutionary Robotics/Artificial Life

              at the AI Lab, University of Zurich
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A new PhD student position is open at the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory, Department of Information Technology, University of Zurich,
Switzerland.
Availability: Immediately or at earliest convenience.

The position is dedicated to research in Evolutionary Robotics/Artificial
Life. In particular, the research focus will be on one or several of the
following topics:

- the generation of simple artificial organisms capable of exhibiting
  behavior (in simulation and in the real world)
- mechanisms of ontogenetic development
- the interaction of microscopic (genome, cell) and macroscopic (behavior)
  processes
- the investigation of the interdependence of environment, morphology, and
  control
- the incorporation of biological insights at appropriate levels of abstraction
  into computer/robotic models

Previous work on an "Artificial Evolutionary System" that implements
pertinent biological concepts can serve as a starting point. This research
is intended to bring together ideas from biology, engineering, and computer
science in novel and productive ways.

If these challenges attract your interest and if you would like to become a
member of an international research team conducting transdisciplinary work,
please submit a curriculum vitae, statement of research interests, and the
names of three references to:

Rolf Pfeifer, Director AI Lab

Fax:    +41 1 635 68 09

Profile: Applicants should have a master's degree, or equivalent
(e.g. diploma or "licence" (Lizentiat)), in one of
the following areas: biology, neurobiology, computer science, electrical or
mechanical engineering, physics, mathematics (or related disciplines).
Ability to work in a strongly interdisciplinary team is expected.

Tasks: The main task for the accepted candidate will be to conduct research
towards his/her Ph.D. Additional tasks include support for classes
organized by the AI-Lab.

Financial: The salary will be according to the specification of the
University of Zurich.

Time prospect: The candidate is expected to complete his/her Ph.D. work
within a period of maximum 4 years.
