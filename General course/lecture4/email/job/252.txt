Post-doctoral position in computational vision at the Neural Systems
Group, Department of Psychology, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK
http://www.psychology.ncl.ac.uk/neural_systems_group.html

Applications are invited for a post-doctoral scientist position (up to
£30,626, depending on experience) for a research in computational
neuroscience. The post is funded for 3 years in a first instance by an
EU programme aimed at using concurrent psychophysics, computational
models and neurophysiology to investigate mechanisms in visual neurons
during natural image processing.
Research topics for the computational neuroscience position will
include: computational models of  properties of visual neurons when they
are stimulated with natural images; computational models of the role of
prior knowledge of the statistics of the natural visual environment in
visual perception;
quantitative analysis of the response properties of visual neurons
responding to natural images; developing new computational approaches
for data in structure-function relationships (in particular relating
connectivity, activation and information dynamics in the
thalamo-cortical network).

Applicants should possess a PhD in a relevant discipline (i.e.
neuroscience, physics, computing, applied mathematics, engineering or
others), a strong analytical background and a keen interest in vision.
Experience and skills either in neural networks, information theory,
visual psychophysics, visual neuroscience or computer image processing
will be a great advantage.

 Departmental facilities for this work are excellent, and the research
group has recently won more than $14M for the continuing improvement of
its infrastructure.

 Please contact the Departmental Administrator for further details, at
the Neural Systems Group, Department of Psychology, Ridley Building,
Claremont Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU. Tel: +44-191-222-7525,
