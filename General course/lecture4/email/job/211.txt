Post-doctoral Fellowships in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Language and its
Disorders

Two-year National Research Service Award fellowships are available at the 
University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland.  Training 
opportunities will provide experience in the application of contemporary 
research methods (including computational modeling, cognitive neuropsychology,
event-related potentials and functional neuroimaging) to the topic of normal 
and disordered language processing.   Applicants with doctoral degrees in 
related basic science areas (computer sciene, neuroscience, linguistics, 
cognitive psychology, etc.) and clinical disciplines (speech/language 
pathology; clinical neuropsychology) are invited to apply.  Applicants must 
be U.S. citizens or permanent residents to be considered, under the terms 
of the NRSA program.  Inquiries may be directed to Rita Berndt at 
rberndt@umaryland.edu or to Jim Reggia at reggia@cs.umd.edu .   To apply, 
send HARD COPIES of your C.V., the names and addresses of three referees, 
and a statement of research interests and career goals to: 

   Rita S. Berndt, Ph.D. 
   Department of Neurology
