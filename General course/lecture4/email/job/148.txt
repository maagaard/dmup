Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the Brain Imaging
Division, Neuroscience Department, New York State Psychiatric
Institute/Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
We are looking for a person with a background in statistics, mathematics,
or biophysics to work
on the analysis of fMRI data.  This will entail both implementation of
existing software packages as
well as the development of novel methods of analysis.  Our division also
has an extensive and well
developed program in neuroreceptor mapping using PET, and there will be
ample opportunity to
interact with people doing this work as well.
The applicant should have a PhD in one of the above mentioned areas.
Doctoral students nearing
graduation will also be considered.
To apply, send CV and list of 3 references to
