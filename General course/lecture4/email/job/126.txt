Subject: PhD Studentships
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Two three year studentships are offered in the field of 
unsupervised artificial neural networks applied to the 
extraction of information from visual data.

One student will work most closely with Dr Bogdan Gabrys 
and will concentrate on novel cost functions for extraction of 
independent components of visual scenes.

The second will work with Dr Darryl Charles and will concentrate
on additive noise for the creation of minimal code sets for 
sparsely coded visual data.

Each will comprise payment of fees and an annual grant of 
approximately 5500. Both are expected to lead to the award of
PhD within the three year period.

The Applied Computational Intelligence Research Unit is a very
active research unit within the Department of Computing and 
Information Systems comprising some 10 academics, 5 research
assistants and 15 research students.

To apply for either of these posts please send a current CV to 
either char-ci0@paisley.ac.uk or fyfe-ci0@paisley.ac.uk before
30th June 1999.
