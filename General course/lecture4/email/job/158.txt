Postdoctoral Position in Vision Research. A position for a
postdoctoral trainee interested in studying visual perception is
available in the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience at
Rutgers University. The collaboration concerns exploring the
computations needed for spatial perception in the parietal lobe of
behaving primates using single unit recordings, intrinsic optical
imaging techniques, microdialysis and psychophysical methods.
