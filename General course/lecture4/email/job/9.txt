 MRI PHYSICIST POSITION

Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, Institute of Neurology,
University College London

The Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology invites applications for an
MRI physicist position, available from 1st January 1999. The successful
candidate will be the senior Applications Physicist in a research group
supervised by Professor Robert Turner, which maintains, develops and
applies fMRI and related MRI techniques using an optimized Siemens 2.0 T
Vision MR system equipped for EPI. The Department, based at the Functional
Imaging Laboratory, Queen Square, London, is a world leader in the use of
fMRI techniques for a wide range of studies in basic and clinical imaging
neuroscience.

The candidate must possess a Ph.D. degree and demonstrated experience in
MRI sequence development, preferably with Siemens equipment, and would be
encouraged to participate in independent research. Opportunity will exist
for collaborative work on novel MRI and MRS methods for studying the human
brain, to be developed using a high-field 4.7 T whole body MRI scanner to
be installed adjacent to the Functional Imaging Laboratory. The post,
funded by a large Wellcome Trust grant, is available from January 1999 to
31 March 2000 initially, with excellent possibility of renewal. Starting
salary is on the RAIII scale up to £32,630 pa inclusive, depending on
experience. A suitable candidate would be eligible for a University
Lectureship.

Applications (cover letter describing current research interests and future
research goals, CV, and the names of two referees) should be sent by 15th
November 1998 to Miss E Bertram, Assistant Secretary (Personnel), Institute
of Neurology, Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG. Informal enquiries should be
addressed to: Professor Robert Turner, r.turner@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk, Tel: +44
