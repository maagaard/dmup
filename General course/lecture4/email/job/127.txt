PhD STUDENTSHIP AVAILABLE

A three year studentship is available 
in the area of Support Vector Machines 
and their applications. The project 
has a theoretical component and an 
applied component, principally the 
application of SVMs and related 
kernel classifiers to biosequences.

The student will be a member of the 
Computational Intelligence Group 
(see our web pages http://lara.enm.bris.ac.uk/cig/ ) 
which is part of the Advanced Computing 
Research Centre, Bristol University 
(http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/ACRC/ ).

Suitable applicants should have a 
strong mathematical background 
and some additional computing experience 
would be preferred. The studentship 
comprises payment of fees and an annual 
maintenance grant at EPSRC rates.
