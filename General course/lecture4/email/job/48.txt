POST-DOCTORAL POSITION AVAILABLE


The Neural Computational Theory Group in the Racah Institute of Physics 
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has a post-doctoral position open, 
beginning in the fall of 1999. The position will involve working on 
theoretical problems in two areas:

    1.. Supervised and unsupervised learning

    2.. Modeling visual and motor processing in cortical and subcortical 
neuronal structures

The work to be done in the area of modeling is expected to involve 
interaction with experimental groups, which are part of the 
Interdisciplinary Center for Neural Computation at the Hebrew 
University.

Candidates with a strong background in statistical mechanics, in neural 
network theory, or in computational neuroscience are encouraged to 
apply. Those interested should send an application letter along with CV, 
publications list, brief research statement, and three letters of 
recommendation to Professor Haim Sompolinsky. The position will be for 
one year, with the possibility for an extension of up to three years.
