The Sloan Center for Theoretical Neurobiology at UCSF solicits
applications for pre- and post-doctoral fellowships, with the goal of
bringing theoretical approaches to bear on neuroscience. Applicants
should have a strong background and education in mathematics,
theoretical or experimental physics, or computer science, and
commitment to a future research career in neuroscience. Prior
biological or neuroscience training is not required.

The Sloan Center offers opportunities to combine theoretical and
experimental approaches to understanding the operation of the intact
brain. Young scientists with strong theoretical backgrounds will
receive scientific training in experimental approaches to
understanding the operation of the intact brain. They will learn to
integrate their theoretical abilities with these experimental
approaches to form a mature research program in integrative
neuroscience. The research undertaken by the trainees may be
theoretical, experimental, or a combination.

TO APPLY, please send a curriculum vitae, a statement of previous
research and research goals, up to three relevant publications, and
have two letters of recommendation sent to us.

            The application deadline is February 1, 1999. 

Send applications to: 

                        Steve Lisberger
          Sloan Center for Theoretical Neurobiology at UCSF
                    Department of Physiology
                     University of California
                       513 Parnassus Ave.
                  San Francisco, CA 94143-0444

PRE-DOCTORAL applicants with strong theoretical training may seek
admission into the UCSF Neuroscience Graduate Program as a first-year
student. Applicants seeking such admission must apply by Jan. 5, 1999
to be considered for fall, 1999 admission. Application materials for
the UCSF Neuroscience Program may be obtained from

                         Cindy Kelly 
                 Neuroscience Graduate Program 
                    Department of Physiology 
               University of California San Francisco 
                  San Francisco, CA 94143-0444 
                   neuroscience@phy.ucsf.edu 

Be sure to include your surface-mail address. The procedure is: make a
normal application to the UCSF Neuroscience program; but also alert
the Sloan Center of your application, by writing to Steve Lisberger at
the address given above.
