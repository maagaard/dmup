Subject: Postdoc position available at SNN Nijmegen
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Post doc position available at SNN, University of Nijmegen, the
Netherlands.

Background:
The group consists of 10 researchers and PhD students and conducts
theoretical and applied research on neural networks and Bayesian
methods. The group is part
of the Laboratory of Biophysics which is involved in experimental brain
science.

Recent research of the group has focused on theoretical description of
learning processes using the theory of stochastic processes and the design
of efficient learning rules for Boltzmann machines and other graphical
models using techniques from
statistical mechanics; the extraction of rules from data and the
integration of knowledge and data for modeling; the design of robust
methods for confidence estimation with neural networks. Applied research
is conducted on computer assisted medical diagnosis and prediction 
tasks. Since 1997, SNN Nijmegen has founded a company which sells 
commercial services and products in the field of neural networks, AI 
and statistics. For more information see also http://www.mbfys.kun.nl/SNN

Job specification:
The tasks of the post-doc will be to conduct independent research in one
of the above areas. In addition, it is expected that the post-doc will
initiate novel research and will assist in the supervision of PhD students.
The postdoc should have a PhD in physics, mathematics or computer
science and a strong theoretical background in neural networks.
The post-doc salary will be maximally Dfl. 7396 per month, depending on
experience. The position is available for 2 years with possible
extension to 4 years.

Applications:
Interested candidates should send a letter with a CV and list of
