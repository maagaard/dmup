 Post-doctoral research associate for gene expression analysis
 (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer and University of Manchester)

We are looking for a post-doctoral research associate to work on a 2
year project on the analysis of gene expression patterns from DNA
arrays. The work would be done in a collaboration between
Rhône-Poulenc Rorer and the University of Manchester. The post would
provide an ideal opportunity for a mathematically trained scientist to
apply their skills to one of the fastest growing and most exciting
areas of modern biology.

The successful candidate will work primarily at Rhône-Poulenc
Rorer's site near London and liaise extensively with
experimentalists. He/she will be part of a large multidisciplinary
team involving biologists and bioinformaticians that is applying and
developing state of the art mathematical and computational methods for
biologically relevant problems.

The ideal candidate would have excellent communication skills, a
mathematical background, preferably in areas such as multivariate
statistical analysis and pattern recognition, and a strong interest in
molecular biology.

As an Equal Opportunities Employer, we welcome applications from
suitably qualified people from all sections of the community
regardless of race, religion, gender or disability.
