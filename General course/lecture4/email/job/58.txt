Graduate Student or Postdoctoral Position in Computational Functional MRI:
from Fall 1999
(possible summer 99)

>This  exciting new venture in the Brain and Vision Research Laboratory at
>Boston University, Department of Biomedical Engineering involves
>visualisation the working (plasticity and restorative plasticity) of the
>human brain  during sensory-motor tasks.
> Specifically, the postholder will:
>
>    * establish new protocols of functional imaging on a research MRI
>scanner, 		including the stimulus presentation system,
>software and interfacing.
>
>    * work with other members of the laboratory to define, establish
>  and run suitable test paradigms on healthy volunteers and patients
>
>    *  explore the uses of real-time and near-real-time analysis
>techniques in fMRI studies.
>    * model the  changes of functional connectivity of brain activations
>using  structural equations models and functional connectivity models.
>
>It is possible that for part of the time the RA will work at an NIH
>laboratory, in Bethesda, MA.
>
>Candidates should  have good background inC programming,  mathematics,
>signal processing and probability and should be familiar with the Unix
>environment. Knowledge of human neuroanatomy is a plus.
