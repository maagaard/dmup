Postdoctoral Position Available in Neuroimaging and Computational Neuroscience:

A postdoctoral position is available in an NINDS-funded research project
combining human neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI),  healthy and patient population
psychophysics, rat electrophysiology (multi-unit recordings), and
computational modeling to investigate novel hypotheses about cerebellar
function.  The project is a collaboration between James Bower (at Caltech)
and Lawrence Parsons and Peter Fox (at the Research Imaging Center,
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio).  Term of
position is 2-3 years,available immediately.  Particular interest exists
for candidates with a Ph.D. or M.D. who have experience in neuroimaging,
experimental psychophysics, or neurology.  Qualified women and minority
candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.  Send CV, three letters of
recommendation, and two reprints to either: Professor J. M. Bower, Division
of Biology 216-76, California Institute of Biology, Pasadena, CA 91125,
USA; or Professor L. M. Parsons, Research Imaging Center, University of
Texas Health Science Center, 7703 Floyd Curl Drive, San Antonio, TX 78284,
USA.  Email inquiries can be made to parsons@uthscsa.edu or
jbower@bbb.caltech.edu.  For related publications, see: Gao, Parsons, Bower
et al., Science 272, 545 1996;  and the chapters by Bower and by Parsons &
Fox in Cerebellum & Cognition (J. Schmahmann, Ed., Academic Press, 1997).
