Post-doctoral Fellowship in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Language and its
Disorders

Two-year post-doctoral fellowship available  after July 1, 1999, at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland.   
Training opportunities will provide experience in the application of
contemporary research methods (including computational modeling, cognitive
neuropsychology,  event-related potentials and functional neuroimaging)  to
the topic of normal and disordered language processing.   Applicants with
doctoral degrees in related basic science areas (cognitive psychology,
neuroscience, linguistics, computer  science, etc.) and clinical
disciplines (speech/language pathology; clinical neuropsychology) are
invited to apply.  Questions may be directed to rberndt@umaryland.edu.   To
apply, send HARD COPIES of  C.V., names and addresses of three referees,
and statement of research interests and career goals to: Rita S. Berndt,
Ph.D., Department of Neurology, University of Maryland School of Medicine,
22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, Maryland  21201.  Applications should be
received by July 1, 1999, for full consideration.
