Two research posts (Portsmouth/London) are available for projects in Biological Data Mining, one post-doctoral research fellow and one research studentship.

A Postdoctoral Research Fellow is required for the project
"Biological data mining: A comparison of neural network and symbolic
techniques" funded by the joint BBSRC/EPSRC programme in bioinformatics.

The Research Fellow will be based in the Centre for Molecular Design at
the University of Portsmouth.

This post requires either a graduate with a PhD in Computer Science,
Cognitive Science, Mathematics or a related subject, with an interest
in applying machine learning techniques in the field of bioinformatics;
or a graduate with a PhD in the Life Sciences with a thorough
understanding of bioinformatics and strong mathematical and programming
skills.

The successful candidate will be required to:

* design, implement and test novel numerical algorithms in a high-level programming language
* apply new and existing software to biological datasets
* perform statistical analyses of the results

The ideal candidate will possess knowledge in some of the following
areas:

* experience of developing neural networks in high level programming languages
* strong mathematical and statistical skills (including Bayesian statistics)
* an understanding of symbolic machine learning techniques
* skills in Matlab, C/C++, Unix
* an awareness of current developments in bioinformatics

The starting salary for this post will be in the range stlg 17,606 - 19,203.


A Postgraduate Research Student is required to perform research on using neural networks with biological and chemical datasets.
The Research Student will be based in the School of Computing,
Information Systems and Mathematics at London Guildhall University.
This post requires either a graduate with a good first degree in Computer Science,
Cognitive Science, Mathematics or a related subject, with an interest
in applying machine learning techniques in the field of bioinformatics;
or a graduate with a good first degree in the Life Sciences with a thorough
understanding of bioinformatics and strong mathematical and programming
skills.

The successful candidate will be required to:

* design, implement and test novel numerical algorithms in a high-level programming language
* apply new and existing software to biological datasets
* perform statistical analyses of the results

A tax-free bursary is provided for this post, to a level commensurate with standard 
research council PHD studentships.

The candidate will be encouraged to register for a PhD. 
As this studentship is internally funded some formal teaching will be required 
(typically up to 6 hours of laboratory supervision).


Both of the above posts will be of 3 years duration, and will start as soon as possible.

To apply please e-mail a CV (in text format) including the names (and e-mail addresses) of two
referees to Dr. Antony Browne (abrowne@lgu.ac.uk) by 19th November 1999.
