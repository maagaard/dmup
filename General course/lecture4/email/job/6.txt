JOB ADVERT

SALARY GRADE 1B -   15,735 - 18,275  	



A Research Officer is sought to work with Dr. Emmanuel Pothos and
Professor Nick Chater on an exciting project relating to human
categorisation.

In the first instance, the project would involve computer implementation
and analysis of an information theory model of classification, developed
by Pothos and Chater. Subsequently, human experimental work would be
designed to investigate the psychological plausibility of the project. 

Although the emphasis will be on the psychological implications of the
theory, statistical applications will be also be pursued, with a view to
addressing clustering, data mining problems. 

Candidates should have a high level of computer programming competence
(preferably C, or Matlab); expertise in the statistics clustering
literature, and human experimental skills are desirable but not necessary.
Thus, we welcome applications with a Ph.D. or a good MSc in computer
science, statistics, cognitive psychology and related disciplines. 

The post will be for one year commencing January 1999 (although this is
flexible), held at the University of Wales, Bangor, one of the fastest
growing departments in the UK, which received a 5A rating in the most
recent RAE. 

Application forms and further particulars are available by contacting :
Personnel Services, University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd,  LL57 2DG.
tel.:  01248-382926/388132.  e-mail:  pos020@bangor.ac.uk.


Please quote  reference number 98/201 when applying.

Closing date for applications:  Monday 16th November 1998.

Informal enquiries can be made by contacting Dr Emmanuel Pothos e.mail:
e.pothos@bangor.ac.uk, or Professor Nick Chater e.mail:
