	POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOW & RESEARCH PROGRAMMER
		IN NEURAL SIMULATION METHODS

The NEOSIM project, funded by  NIMH and NSF, is developing simulation
environments and associated software tools for modelling of brain
processes.  The project has computer science and neuroscience research
goals, and aims to develop distributable, portable, parallel software
for the computational neuroscience community.  We seek a postdoctoral
Research Fellow and a Research Programmer to augment the existing
multidisciplinary, multinational team.  Both posts may require some
travel to other EU countries or the US.

The Research Fellow will conduct original research  related to brain
modeling, brain data analysis or parallel simulation techniques and will
contribute design, documentation, programming or other relevant
expertise to the software development goals of the project.

The Research Programmer will be involved in design, documentation,
implementation, testing, dissemination, maintenance and development of
the NEOSIM framework and will also be responsible for the installation
and maintenance of software packages on the research computers, and may
be involved in the specification, installation and system administration
of research computers including small parallel platforms.

Tenable for up to 3 years subject to annual renewal and further renewal
beyond 3 years subject to success in attracting further funding.

Salary scale: £16,286 - £24,479 p.a.
