NSF-SPONSORED TRAINING PROGRAM IN NEUROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS AT CWRU

Predoctoral fellowships are now available in a new multidisciplinary
graduate program in Neuro-Mechanical Systems at Case Western Reserve
University. Neuro-mechanical systems include natural, man-made, or  hybrid
systems combining neural controllers and mechanical peripheries. Examples
include natural organisms, biologically inspired robots, and
neuroprostheses for restoring motor function in the disabled.

We are seeking outstanding students with backgrounds in biology,
neuroscience, biomedical engineering, computer engineering and science,
electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering. Students participating
in this program will learn the skills necessary to work in this exciting
new multidiciplinary area. This program, funded by the National Science
Foundations Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training initiative
(NSF IGERT), brings together four research groups focused on the
neurobiology and biomechanics of movement behavior, on bio-robotics, on
evolution and analysis of model neuro-mechanical systems, and on motor
system neuroprostheses.

The program involves eight faculty from four Departments: Biology,
Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and
Mechanical Engineering:

	Randall Beer, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
	Michael Branicky, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
	Hillel Chiel, Biology
	Patrick Crago, Biomedical Engineering
	Warren Grill, Biomedical Engineering
	Robert Kirsch, Biomedical Engineering
	Roger Quinn, Mechanical Engineering
	Roy Ritzmann, Biology

Students in the training program will participate in cross-disciplinary
courses and rotate through laboratories in all four fields. The program
includes a multidisciplinary seminar featuring extended visits from leaders
in each field. Funds will permit travel to scientific meetings and
workshops in each field. Common computer facilities and office areas will
be provided for students in the program. Internships in clinical and
industrial settings will also be available as options. We are particularly
interested in recruiting under-represented minorities. Students must be
U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents of the United States.

Further details of the program can be found at

Roy Ritzmann, Department of Biology, Case Western Reserve University,
