Could you please forward this ad to any friends or contacts of yours
who might be interested in visiting Cornell next spring in connection
with our new NSF IGERT program in Nonlinear Systems?  (See our web
page http://www.chaos.cornell.edu/IGERT.html for a description of the
program.)  Also, if you have suggestions for bulletin boards or places
on the web where I should post this ad, please let me know.  Thanks,

Visiting Position in Nonlinear Systems


Cornell University seeks a visiting scholar to participate in an
interdisciplinary graduate training program in Nonlinear Systems,
funded by an IGERT grant from the National Science Foundation. (See the
web page http://www.chaos.cornell.edu/IGERT.html  for a description of
the training program's educational goals, faculty, and current
research.)


The visiting position is available for the Spring semester of 2000, and
includes compensation of $25,000.  It may be possible to arrange for
additional support, in exchange for teaching a section of an
undergraduate course in a department of the candidate's expertise
(subject to departmental needs). 


The visitor would hold the title of Visiting Scholar and would be
expected to interact (and perhaps collaborate) with the students and
faculty in the program, and to participate in all aspects of the
research and training activities, including weekly colloquia and
informal seminars.  An ideal candidate would be a mathematician,
scientist, engineer, or social scientist who enjoys interdisciplinary
interactions with faculty and students from a wide range of fields. 
Women and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.  


Interested applicants should send a CV, a summary of research
interests, and a brief statement explaining why this program appeals to
them, to
