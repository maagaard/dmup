Since the emergence and explosive growth of the World Wide
Web (WWW) there has been a commensurate growth in the
availability of online information. Efficient searching and retrieval of
relevant information from the WWW has lagged behind this growth
and intelligent information retrieval methods are now required as a
matter of urgency. This particular challenge is attracting great
interest from the machine learning research community and many
software companies are closely monitoring the research output.
There are two main approaches to online information retrieval, (1)
query based and (2) taxonomic. The query based approach relies
on methods such as search engines; which take a users query
and this is compared with an existing document collection to find
the most likely match. The taxonomic approach relies on manual
organisation of the information (online documents) into hierarchic
categorisations of the document collection. It is accepted that the
design of information retrieval systems utilising a number of
intelligent computing paradigms may provide the key to improved
information access. This project proposes the fusion of both
unsupervised and supervised computational models to adaptively
build and maintain suitable document hierarchies (an example
being Kohonen's WEBSOM) and then rank and classify existing as
well as incoming new documents based on user queries (an
example being Bayesian networks). 

Three years of  University funding, for a  PhD studentship, is
available for this project. This project will be carried out in
collaboration with a US based software company. Interested
