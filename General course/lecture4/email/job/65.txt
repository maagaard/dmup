Postdoctoral Position in Computational Motor Control
-----------------------------------------------------

The Computational Learning and Motor Control Laboratory at the 
University of Southern California, which is part of the Kawato
Dynamic Brain Project at ATR in Japan, is looking for an outstanding 
postdoctoral fellow in Computational Motor Control. The position 
is available starting from April 99, initially for one year, but 
can be renewed until Sept. 2001.

  Research topics of our group are strongly interdisciplinary.
On the one hand, we are interested in developing formal theories of
how the mammalian brain solves problems of sensory motor control.
On the other hand, we also try to test these theories with humanoid
robots, ranging from human-arm-like robots up to a full-body humanoid
with a complete oculomotor and vestibular system. We also employ 
behavioral experiments to compare human performance against robot 
performance and our developed theories. A strong emphasis of our 
research lies on developing statistical learning mechanisms for the 
self-organization of motor control, for instance, applied to the 
learning of internal models, the self-organization of internal 
representations, or high-level topics like imitation learning. 
More information can be found at:
http://www-slab.usc.edu   or  http://www.erato.atr.co.jp

  The ideal candidate for this position has a strong background in
statistical learning and neural networks, in computational neuroscience
of motor control, in behavioral motor control, as well as in dealing
with experimental and computer equipment. The candidate is expected
to independently lead research projects, supervise students, and 
interact with our Japan-based part of the project through visits to
Japan. The postdoctoral position allows a great deal of flexibility
concerning the research topic as long as it fits within the broad
range of our group's interests in computational motor control.

  Before sending any formal applications, including a CV and at least
3 letters of recommendation, send a (brief!!) email letter of intent to
sschaal@usc.edu (Dr. Stefan Schaal), briefly describing your past
and current research interests, and how you would imagine to 
integrate in our projects.
