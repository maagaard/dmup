The computational learning theory group of the National University of
Singapore is looking for a postdoc.  The focus of the project funding
the position is the search for theoretically principled, practical
algorithms for machine learning.  The postdoc will be free to pursue
independent research along these general lines, but will also have the
opportunity to collaborate with the members of the group.  The starting
date is somewhat flexible, but should be some time before September, 2000.
The position runs for two years.

If you are interested, please send your CV and the names of three references
to plong@comp.nus.edu.sg by January 15, 2000.
