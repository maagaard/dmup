Dear Colleagues,

     The University of California, Davis, and the National Science
Foundation have established a multidisciplinary training group,
"Nonlinear Dynamics in Biology".  The program is designed to provide
graduate students with research training that will allow them to
address questions in biology using computational and mathematical
modelling.  Specifically, our trainees focus on complex processes in
cell biology, neuroscience, biofluiddynamics, ecology, and population
biology that involve nonlinear dynamics.

     The curriculum includes training in computational, mathematical,
and experimental methods.  Students are mentored by faculty trainers,
postdoctoral researchers, and more advanced graduate students in both
formal and informal settings.  Financial support is available for all
graduate trainees.

     Admission to the graduate training program requires strong
interest in biological research that involves nonlinear dynamics,
acceptance to a graduate program at UC Davis, and a year-long course
in calculus.  We strongly encourage additional coursework in
mathematics, computer science, and biology.

     Please alert students who might be interested in this program to
the training grant web site, http://www.itd.ucdavis.edu/rtg/, for
additional information and application materials. You also may contact
our academic coordinator, Carole Hom (clhom@ucdavis.edu; 530-754-9117)
should you or your students have questions not addressed in the 
information on the web site.

     In addition, we seek postdoctoral fellows in biofluiddynamics,
cell or neurobiology, and population biology or ecology.  Application
materials for postdocs also can be found on the web page.

     Thank you for your assistance.
