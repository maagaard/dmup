The Johns Hopkins University is a major private research university
and its hospital and medical school have been rated consistently as
the first or second in the nation over the last years. The Department
of Neuroscience ranks second in the nation (all according to 'US News
and World Report').

The Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute at Johns Hopkins encourages
students with interest in systems neuroscience, including
computational neuroscience, to apply for the graduate program in the
Neuroscience department. The Institute is an interdisciplinary
research center devoted to the investigation of the neural mechanisms
of mental function and particularly to the mechanisms of perception:
How is complex information represented and processed in the brain, how
is it stored and retrieved, and which brain centers are critical for
these operations?

Research opportunities exist in all of the laboratories of
the Institute. Interdisciplinary projects, involving the student in
more than one laboratory, are particularly encouraged. All students
accepted to the PhD program of the Neuroscience department receive
full tuition remission plus a stipend at or above the National
Institutes of Health predoctoral level.

Additional information on the research interests of the faculty in the
Mind/Brain Institute and the Department of Neuroscience can be
obtained at http://www.mb.jhu.edu/mbi.html and at
http://www.med.jhu.edu/neurosci/welcome.html, respectively.

Applicants should have a B.S. or B.A. with a major in any of the
biological or physical sciences. Applicants are required to take the
Graduate Record Examination (GRE; both the aptitude tests and an
advanced test), or the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). Further
information on the admission procedure can be obtained from the
Department of Neuroscience:

Director of Graduate Studies
Neuroscience Training Program
Department of Neuroscience
The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
725 Wolfe Street 
Baltimore, MD 21205

Completed applications (including three letters of recommendation and
either GRE scores or Medical College Admission Test scores) must be
received by January 1, 1998 at the above address.
