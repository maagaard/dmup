[ Moderator's note: Steve Hanson informs me that people interested in
  doing neural network or connectionist modeling research are among those
  being sought for these graduate fellowships.  The steering committee 
  includes several people who are well-known in the machine learning 
  community.

  GRADUATE AWARDS FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY IN DIGITAL LIBRARIES

The Rutgers University Distributed Laboratory for Digital Libraries
(RDLDL) is pleased to announce the availability of competitive
graduate awards for interdisciplinary doctoral studies in digital
libaries, including contributing technologies and relevant basic
research.

Digital libraries is an exciting new domain for research, and for
society at large, and the RDLDL is taking a leading role in
establishing an explicitly interdisciplinary approach to the variety
of problems in this burgeoning area.  Current faculty members of the
RDLDL come from the disciplines of cognitive science, computer
science, library and information science and psychology, and students
in the program are expected to participate in research and to take
courses in two or more of the disciplines represented in the RDLDL.

Successful candidates will participate in digital library-oriented
research projects with several faculty members of the RDLDL, as well
as being enrolled in a Ph.D. program in one of the disciplines
associated with the RDLDL.  They will also take part in an
interdisciplinary seminar involving the faculty and all of the other
graduate students associated with the RDLDL.

The RDLDL Awards offer tuition remission and an annual stipend of
$13,000, and the opportunity to achieve an interdisciplinary education
for research in the interdisciplinary field of digital libaries. These
awards are tenable for one year in the first instance, beginning in
either January or September 1999, and are renewable.

For further information, including the specific interests of the RDLDL
faculty, and application materials, please see the RDLDL WWW site,
