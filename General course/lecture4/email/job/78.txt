Hello!
    I am intereseted in gaussian process and recurrent neural network
models.  I have a Post-doctoral position available here in manchester, Uk
to work on applied materials problems.

The successful applicant should have a mathematical, physics or engineering
background.  Details are attached.  If you know of anyone interested please
feel free to pass this information on.
  thank you
      Prof Phil Withers


     THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER

     MANCHESTER MATERIALS SCIENCE CENTRE

     RESEARCH ASSOCIATE

     Neural Network Modelling of Al Rolling Process/Property Relationships.

     Applications are invited for a physicist, mathematician, materials
     scientist or engineer to take up a two year post doctoral research
     fellowship in collaboration with ALCAN International, Banbury,
     Oxfordshire.  Experience of mathematical modelling and/or materials
     science and engineering and a keenness to work on applied problems an
     advantage.  The Materials Science Centre in Manchester received the
     highest research assessment grade and has world class expertise in
     light alloys.

     A second post focusing on the finite element modelling of friction
     welding of aerospace components and the measurement of stresses by
     neutron diffraction is also expected to become available shortly.
     Modelling and/or materials science and engineering experience advantageous.

     Salaries for the above posts will be in the range of #17570 to #21815
     p.a. according to qualifications and experience.  For informal
     enquiries please contact Professor P J Withers at the Manchester
