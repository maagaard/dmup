Postdoc Position: Multimodal imaging of reading development and dyslexia

A postdoctoral position is available beginning in April 2000 in the
Skill and Language Research Lab at the MGH-NMR Center.  This postdoc
will collaborate on studies using a combination of neuroimaging
techniques (functional MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, diffuse optical
tomography, and MEG) to examine the neural bases of reading acquisition
and dyslexia.  Resources at the NMR Center will include 1.5T, 3T, and 7T
MRI scanners, a 306-channel MEG system, and state-of-the-art optical
imaging systems.

Applicants should have received their Ph.D. (or plan to receive it by
April 2000).  The successful candidate should have a strong background
in psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, reading acquisition, or language
development, and should be comfortable working with children in a
research setting.  In addition, a background in UNIX and computer
programming is desired; some familiarity with neuroimaging techniques is
desired but not necessary.

Women and Minorities are encouraged to apply for this position.

To apply, send CV, statement of research background and interests, and
names and addresses of 3 references to:
