The University of Southern California (USC) Department of Computer
Science (www.usc.edu/dept/cs) invites applications for a tenure-track
position in computational neuroscience/neuroinformatics.  We are
looking for an individual who has an exceptional track record in
modeling large-scale neural systems and working with experimentalists
to link their data to these models. The successful applicant will be
involved in teaching in a computer science and interdisciplinary
environment, and will also have the technical ability to serve as
Associate Director of the USC Brain Project (http://www-hbp.usc.edu).
In particular, the candidate is expected to supervise and contribute
to the development of a database environment for integration of
empirical neuroscience data and brain models.

The computer science community at USC is large and diverse, with
faculty both on the University Park Campus and at USC's Information
Sciences Institute (ISI). Research topics include algorithms and
cryptography, collaborative agents, computational neuroscience,
computer architecture, databases and information management,
educational technology, genomics & DNA computing, graphics and
multi-media, knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation,
learning, natural language processing, networking, neural networks,
neuroinformatics, ontologies, planning, robotics, software
engineering, virtual humans, and vision.

Computer Science at USC has a long history as a key component of the
University's Neuroscience Program (NIBS: Neural, Informational and
Behavioral Sciences) with work in cognitive neuroscience,
computational neuroscience, language mechanisms, neural engineering
(through the Center for Neural Engineering
(http://www.usc.edu/dept/engineering/CNE), neuroinformatics, vision,
and visuomotor coordination (with links to biomimetic robotics). In
particular, the USC Brain Project (USCBP), funded in part by the Human
Brain Project consortium, integrates empirical research in the
neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and neurophysiology of synaptic
plasticity, motivation, and visuomotor coordination with research in
neuroinformatics, adapting such computational techniques as databases,
the World Wide Web, data mining, and visualization to the analysis of
neuro-science data, and employing computational neuroscience to study
the relations between structure and function. USC is also part of the
Dynamic Brain Project, an international research focus on
computational motor control.

USC's broader computer science community includes not only the
Computer Science Department, the Computer Engineering Program and ISI
but also the Integrated Media Systems Center (IMSC), an NSF
Engineering Research Center focusing on computer interfaces,
information management and media communications; and the newly created
Institute for Creative Technologies that brings together expertise
from USC's Schools of Engineering, Cinema-Television, and
Communications (Annenberg) plus the entertainment industry, to develop
the art and technology for compellingly realistic virtual experiences.

Preliminary enquiries and requests for further information may be sent to
Michael Arbib (arbib@pollux.usc.edu).

Applicants should send a comprehensive resume, a list of references,
and a statement of goals to: Paulina Tagle, Computer Science, USC SAL
300, Los Angeles, CA 90089-0781 (paulina@pollux.usc.edu). USC is an
Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer and encourages
applications from women and minorities.
