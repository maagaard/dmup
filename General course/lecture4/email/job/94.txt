The Dept. of Medical Physics and Biophysics of the University of Nijmegen,
The Netherlands, has a vacancy for a

Ph.D. STUDENT


RESEARCH PROJECT

The research project has a theoretical component and an application
oriented component.

The theoretical component deals with knowledge extraction from
neural-network related architectures, which have been trained using large
data-bases. Our group has a large experience with Multi-layer Perceptrons,
staochastic neural networks and graphical models (see
http://www.mbfys.kun.nl/snn).
The application oriented part deals with optimization of the production
process in a paper production plant. The aim of the project is to train a
neural network (or related architecture) with data, obtained during the
paper production process, and then
-- to find the main relevant parameters, which determine the production
process and the quality of the output (quality of paper)
-- to extract rules, which provide insight into the production process
-- to optimize the process.

The project should produce excellent papers in the best available
scientific journals. After a period of 4 years, a thesis should be available.

For applications, please send your cv to:
