OPPORTUNITY FOR POST-GRAD, POST-DOC AND SABBATICAL STUDIES

Cybernetic Vision Research Group
IFSC, University of Sco Paulo,
Caixa Postal 369
Sco Carlos, SP, 13560-970
Brazil
____________________________________________________________________

We would like to communicate about possibilities for post-grad,
post-doc and sabbatical programs at the Cybernetic Vision Research
Group, University of Sco Paulo, Brazil.  Additional information is
presented in the following:

THE CYBERNETIC VISION RESEARCH GROUP:  Started in 1993, the
Cybernetic Vision Research Group has become nationally and
internationally recognized for research in the areas of shape
analysis, computer and biological vision, and computational
neuroscience.  The group currently includes 15 researchers, most
of them MSc and PhD students, each with access to individual
computational resources.  The group is part of the Instituto de
Fisica de Sao Carlos, which has modern computational and network
resources (alpha workstations) as well as a well-equipped library.
Additional information can be found at the following homepages:

*** Group homepage:
           http://cyvision.if.sc.usp.br/
*** Luciano's personal homepage:
           http://www.if.sc.usp.br/visao/group/members/luciano/luciano.htm

SAO CARLOS:  Sao Carlos, where the group is located, is a small and
quiet town (about 150 000 inhabitants) in the heart of the state of
Sao Paulo, in Brazil.  The university campus is within a residential
area, where accommodation is very affordable. Our town, which includes
two major Brazilian universities as well as many small industries, is
know as one of the most prominent Brazilian high-technology centers.
Sao Carlos is not far from Sao Paulo (230km), the state capital, where
flights to most Brazilian and international destinations can be found.
Weather is mild (no snow throughout the year), with an average
temperature around 20C.

RESEARCH POSSIBILITIES:  Well-motivated and dynamic students and
researchers, with background in the most diverse areas - including
Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Biology, and
Medicine - are  welcome to apply for studies in our group.  The full
time MSc and PhD programs last up to 2 and 4 years, respectively, but
it is possible to proceed directly to PhD.  Post-doc and sabbatical
programs can last from a few months to one year or more.  It is
possible to apply for Brazilian sponsorship covering travelling
and/or the basic living expenses.

Research possibilities include but are not limited to the following:

*1* Neuromorphology and neuromorphic modeling: development of new
neural shape measures, validation, and application to classification
of neural cells and neuromorphic modeling.  We are particularly
interested in investigating how neural shapes constrain and help
define neural behavior;
*2* Scale space shape representations in 2D and 3D, including
multiresolution curvature and skeletonization, singularity theory,
differential geometry and differential equations;
*3* Visual inspection and image analysis applied to microscopy;
*4* Mathematical physics applications to image analysis and vision;
*5* Datamining and its applications to visual design, visual
quality assessment, neural modeling, and shape analysis.

Candidates should contact Prof Luciano da F. Costa at
luciano@if.sc.usp.br, indicating the specific interests and including
curricular information as well as at least three addresses for
recommendation purposes.
