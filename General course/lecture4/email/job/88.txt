The Birkbeck College (University of London) psychology department has a
number of full-time PhD scholarships for students commencing their degrees
in October 1999. These are open to students wishing to undertake projects
comprising of computational methods (connectionist/neural network
and mathematical models) combined with experimental psychology.

The department has a strong commitment to cognitive neuroscience and
computational modelling. Strong candidates are invited to apply (see FULL
ANNOUNCEMENT below) for a variety of cognitive neuroscience projects
supervised by Denis Mareschal and/or by Marius Usher, as described:

Denis Mareschal (http://www.psyc.bbk.ac.uk/staff/dm.html)
   connectionist modelling of perceptual and cognitive development in childhood
   and infancy

Marius Usher (http://www.ukc.ac.uk/psychology/people/usherm/)
  Behavioral and computational studies of: choice reaction time,
  short-term and working memory and cognitive performance,
  information processing in the frontal lobes.

The  Birkbeck College psychology department includes the
recently founded Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development
(headed by Professor Mark Johnson) and is well complemented by a new
cognitive science laboratory consisting of a suit of
UNIX-based workstations dedicated to computational modelling research.
Birkbeck College is situated in the Bloomsbury section of London and
students would  benefit from its close proximity to the Gatsby
Computational Neuroscience Unit and the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience.
