the establishment of a new Masters in Systems Science (currently in
the approval process); 5) initiate and guide activities to expand
funding for research and program development; and 6) direct the
student recruiting efforts.

Applicants should have an earned doctorate in Systems Science or
related discipline and experience in an academic setting including
teaching, research publications and grants.
