     Postdoctoral Positions in Functional Neuroimaging

     Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences
     Stanford University School of Medicine


     Two postdoctoral positions are available in the Stanford Psychiatry
     Neuroimaging Laboratory to participate in a wide range of functional
     MRI
     research projects. The projects will investigate perceptual and
     cognitive function
     and development in normal children and their dysfunction in specific
     psychiatric
     and neurogenetic disorders. We are looking for candidates with a
     strong background
     in neuroscience/neuropsychology/cognitive neuroscience/  and
     fMRI/PET
     research experience. Opportunities exist for participation in
     ongoing research projects
     as well as the development of new ones that match the candidate's
     specific experience and interests.

     Applicants should send a curriculum vitae together with a list of
     publications,
     summary of research experience and research interests, and the names
     of three referees to:
