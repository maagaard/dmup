> These are exciting opportunities for graduate students to research in
> neuroimaging and neurocomputing, which are available through a
> collaborative research project between Singapore Gamma Knife Center,
> Singapore General Hospital, and the School of Applied Science, Nanyang
> Technological University.
> 
> The functional MRI scans of human brain during cognitive tasks, obtained
> at the MRI facility of the Singapore General Hospital will be analyzed
> using neural network paradigms and statistical techniques to detect human
> brain activation. Students will join a research group analyzing functional
> MR images and time-series to interpret human brain activities and infer
> neuronal events in cognitive experiments. The research positions are
> initially available to complete Masters degree, and may be continued
> towards Ph.D. degree depending on the performance in the first year.
> 
> Research students will receive a monthly stipend above S$1400 depending on
> the qualifications.
> The positions will be available during the year 1999.
