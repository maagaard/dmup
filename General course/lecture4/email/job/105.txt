| ******************************
| Post-doctoral research position (1-2 years) in Brain imaging research
| 
| Department :
| Department of Radiology, Geneva University Hospital: Division of nuclear
| medicine
| 
| Location :
| 	Division of nuclear medicine
| 
| Description :
| Software designer / Data processing specialist, and medical imaging expert
| Activity : 100 %
| One-year position (possibly renewable for a second year)
| Availability: as soon as possible
| 
| Position created by and depending from the University of Geneva
| Interfaculty Program of Cognitive Neurosciences
| 
| Funding :
| University of Geneva Interfaculty Program of Cognitive Neuroscience
| 
| Goals :
| 1) Applied research activities in a pluridisciplinary team (physicians,
| medical imaging scientist,  neuropsychologists) in the neuroimaging
| laboratory of the division of nuclear medicine and for the University of
| Geneva Interfaculty Program of Cognitive Neuroscience
| 
| a. Development of a 3D image processing tool allowing a voxel to voxel
| determination of differences between a single individual and a normal
| population reference sample in regional cerebral blood flow measured by
| Xenon-133 and HMPAO SPECT, ECD activation rCBF SPECT and FDG PET (as
| function of gender, age and laterality).
| b. Elaboration of a statistical tool allowing to calculate and determine
| significant thresholds in such differences (by analogy to
| osteodensitometry, the concept of "significant pathologic threshold" should
| be associated with z-score and T-score computation)
| c. Creation of an image processing tool which can resume graphically the
| results obtained through the previously listed processing.
| d. Implementation into existing software used in the division of nuclear
| medicine (Toshiba Medical, Sensor System MEDx, USA)
| 2) Active participation to the interdisciplinary project "Brain energy
| metabolism in dementias of the Alzheimer type: physiopathological
| mechanisms and correlations with functional brain imaging and cognitive
| performance" (granted by the Swiss National Research Fund)
| 3) Write-up of publications on the research projects in progress
| 4) Elaboration of new research projects, and grant proposals
| 
| 
| Requirements :
| Doctoral degree.
| Qualifications in functional imaging (PET and SPECT) data processing and
| analysis.
| Use of SUN SPARC workstations, implemented with MATLAB and various other
| software (MEDx, IMAGEMATCH, SPM).
|
