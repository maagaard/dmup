POSTDOC AND PhD POSITIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE

The University of Bern, Switzerland, is building an interdisciplinary research
group in Computational Neuroscience supported by the Department of Physiology
and the Institute of Mathematics. As part of this effort, several positions will
become available on 1/4/1999:

1 Post-doctoral position in Computational Neuroscience (up to 3 years)
1 Post-doctoral position in Experimental Neuroscience (up to 3 years)
1 Pre-doctoral (Ph.D.)  position in Computational Neuroscience (4 years)

The theoretical work of the existing group focuses on short-term synaptic
adaptation, single neuron computation and dynamics of networks of spiking
neurons. The recent  experimental studies at the Physiological Institute concern
LTP/LTD experiments on activity-dependent cortical synapses, dendritic signal
processing and the culturing of networks on multi-electrode arrays. Candidates
with research activities in one of these fields are encouraged to apply, but
strong candidates with research in a related topic will also be considered. For
additional information see http://pylp76.unibe.ch/~fniwww/jobs/NCjobsMore.html .

Please send a letter of application along with CV, publication list, brief 
statement of current research, and two letters of recommendation before February
20, 1999, to

Dr. Walter Senn
Department of Physiology
University of Bern
Bhlplatz 5
CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland
