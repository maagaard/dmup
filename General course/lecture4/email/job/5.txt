          *** Postdoctoral Research Associate *** 

        Institute of Statistics & Decision Sciences
                     Duke University

Applications are invited for a position as a post-doctoral 
research associate in the Institute of Statistics and Decision 
Sciences, Duke University. This is an initial three-year 
appointment, with a target starting date of May 1st, 1999.

The position arises as part of a new multi-disciplinary
research project on multi-scale modeling and simulation in 
scientific inference, funded by NSF. This project, conducted 
through the Center for Multi-Scale Modeling and Distributed 
Computing at Duke, combines research teams from statistics, 
hydrology, mathematics and computer science, and has key 
research focuses in challenging problems of spatial statistical 
modeling and advanced statistical computation. Applied project 
components concern important problems in environmental and 
petroleum hydrology. The project begins in May 1999 with an 
initial three year term. 

The Postdoctoral Research Associate will focus on research 
related to the development of novel multi-resolution spatial 
models, advanced statistical computation, and methodology for 
integrating data sources in an applied setting. The associate 
will work closely with ISDS researchers and investigators and 
postdoctoral associates in mathematics, computing and 
hydrology. Suitable applicants will have a PhD in Statistics 
or a related field. We particularly seek candidates with 
experience in spatial modeling and advanced scientific 
computing, and with inclinations towards cross-disciplinary 
research.  Applications from suitably qualified women and 
minority candidates are particularly encouraged. Duke 
University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
