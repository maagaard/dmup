Applications are invited for three posts to work with Dr. Daniel
Wolpert under a Wellcome Programme Grant entitled Computational Human
Sensorimotor Control. These positions are available for three years in
the first instance with a starting date from January 2000, but
candidates who wish to start later in 2000 are also encouraged to
apply.  Further details of all posts are available on
http://www.hera.ucl.ac.uk

TWO POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWS 
Two Fellows are required with PhDs relevant to the study of human
motor control. One Fellow will work on modelling of the motor system
using optimal control and connectionist approaches and should have a
background in a computational field (e.g. Computational Neuroscience,
Engineering, Physics, Maths). One Fellow will work on psychophysical
studies of human motor control and should have a background in an
experimental field (e.g. Neuroscience, Psychology).

RESEARCH ASSISTANT 
The Research Assistant will provide software and hardware support for
the group.  Experience with C/C++ programming essential and experience
with NT, Linux, OpenGL, external device interface/control and
electronics would be advantageous.

Starting salary for all positions is up to £27,586 pa inclusive,
`depending on experience. Applications (2 copies of CV and names of 3
referees) to Miss E Bertram, Assistant Secretary (Personnel),
Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG (fax: +44 (0)
171 278 5069) by 1 December 1999.  Informal enquiries to Dr. Daniel
Wolpert (email: wolpert@hera.ucl.ac.uk; tel: 0171 837 3611 ext 4183;
fax: 0171 813 3107).
