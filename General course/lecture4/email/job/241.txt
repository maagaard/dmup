Dear Connectionists,

A number of faculty positions are being currently advertised in
the Department of Computer Science in Sheffield.

For one of these, we are looking for someone in the area of Machine
Learning  - this post was created with my appointment here, and the 
target candidate will be someone with research interest in Probabilistic
Modelling with a signal processing bias.

UK academic jobs pay low and are increasingly stressful due to falling 
Maths standards of students coming in.  But this is still a nice job!

Please visit    http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk   if you might be interested,
or pass this to anyone you think might be interested.

Closing date 20 December 1999.

Many thanks
niranjan
