COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE PhD-POSITION AVAILABLE
                 Dept. of Computer Science
               Technical University of Berlin


A PhD-position in the field of computational neuroscience is now
available at the neural information processing group (Prof. Klaus
Obermayer), Dept. of Computer Science of the Technical University of
Berlin.

The project aims at the development of new neural and statistical
methods for the analysis of data sets generated by optical imaging of
intrinsic signals. This method utilizes neural-activity related changes
in the light reflectance of neural tissue, which are mediated by
variations in local blood-oxygenation, blood-flow, blood volume and
light scattering. The raw data sets contain a superposition of several
signal components, only some of which are related to neural activity
with a sufficiently high spatial resolution.

The methods to be developed include:

(i) Theoretical studies of the image generation process by Monte-Carlo
simulations of light propagation in neuronal tissue.

(ii) Development and application of methods for adaptive 
denoising of the data sets and the extraction of stimulus-related
signals from these data sets.

Requirements: The candidate should have a degree in physics,
mathematics, engineering or computer science and a strong 
background in theory. 

Appointment: The appointment will initially be for two years but 
can be extended by one more year. The salary is determined according to
BAT IIa/2 corresponding to a net salary (after deduction of 
taxes) of approx. DM 1700.-- per month.
