<fontfamily><param>Times</param><smaller>Applications are invited for a
postdoctoral position funded by the Medical Research Council of Canada.
 The applicant will conduct research on the temporal sequencing of
information processing in the human brain.  The research involves using
psychophysical methods in combination with a new fMRI technique having
the kind of high-temporal resolution characteristic of VEPs (See Menon,
R.S. & Kim, S. (1999).  Spatial and temporal limits in cognitive
neuroimaging with fMRI.  Trends In Cognitive Sciences, 3 (6), 207-216).
 In particular, the research will involve further development of robust
single-event fMRI capabilities and the use of such single-event fMRI to
characterize the relationships between behavioural and neural measures
of response latency to visual stimuli.


The fMRI research will be conducted at the Laboratory for Functional
Magnetic Resonance Research at the Robarts Research Institute adjacent
to the University of Western Ontario campus.  This facility houses one
of only four 4-Tesla magnets in North America. In addition, we have a
simulated fMRI facility that is used to train subjects, develop new
instrumentation, and measure behaviour that cannot be measured directly
in the high field of the actual magnet.


The applicant should have a Ph.D. in experimental psychology or
cognitive neuroscience, preferably with an emphasis on visual
perception. We would like the appointment to begin in September of
1999, but the start date is somewhat negotiable.  The initial
appointment will be for two years with the possibility of an additional
one-year appointment.  Salary will follow Medical Research Council of
Canada guidelines.
