Vacancy: Post-doctoral research assistant at University of Glasgow,
Dept. of Computing Science

Applications are invited for a Post-doctoral Research Assistantship
(RA-1A, salary range 16,286-18,185, depending on experience, up to a
maximum of scale point 6) at the University of Glasgow. The appointee
will be based in the Department of Computing Science. The work will be
directed by R. Murray-Smith (Computing Science), D. M. Titterington
(Statistics) and
K. J. Hunt (Mechanical Engineering). The appointment is for three years,

funded by an EPSRC project "Modern Statistical Approaches to
off-equilibrium modelling for nonlinear system control", which starts on

1st January 2000, or as soon as possible thereafter.

This project aims to develop modern statistical theory and methodology
to improve the performance and interpretability of the multiple-model
approach to modelling and control of dynamic systems in engineering. The

primary application will be in rehabilitation engineering, where
improved modelling and control methods are needed.

Candidates should ideally have a strong statistics background. Skills in

the following areas will be advantageous: Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
methods, Bayesian inference, time series modelling and control. The
candidate should also be keen on applying leading-edge techniques to
challenging problems, and dealing with the concrete programming work
needed to produce successful results. The work will involve algorithm
implementation, application and some system development in MATLAB.

Please send a letter of application and c.v. to Roderick Murray-Smith,
rod@dcs.gla.ac.uk (informal enquiries by e-mail welcome) before the end
of September 1999.

Please note that because of work permit restrictions, non European
Union/European Economic Area nationals can only be considered if no
suitably qualified EU/EEA national can be found.
