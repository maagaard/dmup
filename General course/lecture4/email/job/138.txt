Two postdoctoral positions are available immediately in the Center for
Computational Biology at Montana State University, Bozeman, in the
laboratories of John Miller and Gwen Jacobs. Both positions are to
study information processing in the cercal sensory system of the
cricket. Applicants for both positions should have experience in
electrophysiology.

The focus of the project in Miller's lab is to understand encoding of
dynamic sensory stimuli by ensembles of nerve cells. The primary
experimental approach will be multi-unit extracellular
recording. Candidates should have background in the application of
information theory to analysis of neural systems. The focus of the
project in Dr. Jacobs' lab is to understand the physiological
mechanisms underlying neural encoding in this system. Experimental
approaches will include intracellular and optical recording, and
advanced morphometric analysis of identified nerve cells. For both
projects, analysis of the data will involve the development of
compartmental and analytical models of identified nerve cells and
networks.

Advanced computational, microscopy and physiological recording
facilities are available within the Center, including a 32-processor
SGI Origin2000 computer and a Leica TSP confocal microscope. More
information about the Center for Computational Biology can be found
