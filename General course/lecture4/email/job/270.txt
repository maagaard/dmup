PRE- AND POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS AVAILABLE


Applications are invited from young researchers with an interest in joining
a four-year (2000-2003) EU network project aimed at the development of
models to predict toxicity, starting Spring 2000.
The network consists of laboratories (see the list below) working in
toxicology, computational chemistry and computer science.
Grants are available to work in one of the seven laboratories of the Network.
Grant will be from 1650 to 4320 Euro/month, depending on qualification,
experience and location. Pre-doc positions are compatible with PhD studies.
Post-doc positions require that the candidate holds (or is near to obtain)
a PhD.

Interested candidates should send an application (including CV, summary of
research interests and preferred location) to:
Dr Emilio Benfenati
Head, Laboratory of Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology
Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche "Mario Negri"
Via Eritrea 62, 20157 Milano, Italy

Conditions for EU grants

The researcher must be 35 years old or less at the time of his appointment
(allowances are possible for special cases).

The researcher must be a holder of a doctoral degree or of a degree in an
appropriate subject in Science or Engineering.

The appointment will be for a fixed-term.

The applicant must be a national of a Member State of the European
Community or of an Associated State or have resided in the European
Community for at least five years prior to his appointment.

The applicant must choose a Centre located in a state different from his
national state and he must not have carried out his activities in that
state for more than 12 of the 24 months prior to his appointment.



Research Program

The present project aims to improve the power of models for toxicity
prediction. It will take advantage of the recent advances in computer
science (such as multivariate analysis, neural networks, expert systems,
machine learning, and simulated annealing). Candidates in Computer Science
are expected to work on Machine Learning and KDD and to develop theories
and systems. These will be applied to the validation (verifying the
robustness of reported models and new predictive ones) and development for
real world applications.
Different models will be developed for (eco)toxicology and for
environmental fate prediction. For (eco)toxicology different species will
be considered, as well as different mechanisms of toxic action. In
environmental fate, partitioning between compartments in the environment
and into biota will be studied, as well as degradation.
