An NIMH grant for training researchers in functional MRI provides two years
of fellowship support for a Ph.D, preferably with basic MR physics and
imaging training, to focus on methodological development.  Prior image data
acquisition, pulse sequence programming,  and data analysis experience is
desirable.  Training will focus on developing new and optimizing present
functional MRI methods on 1.5 and 3T GE scanners, including blood
oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging and arterial spin labeling
perfusion imaging, for functional brain studies. Projects include novel
event-related fMRI techniques, quantitative brain perfusion imaging, fast
spiral and EPI scanning, and characterization of brain hemodynamic
responses during activation. Training also includes collaboration with and
involvement in neuropsychiatric functional imaging projects in the
Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory. Mentors include Drs. Yihong Yang, David
Silbersweig, Emily Stern, and Hong Pan in the Functional Neuroimaging
Laboratory.  Dr. Michael Posner is also involved in the training program.

Applications submitted should include a CV, three reference letters and a
letter indicating interests relevant to the grant.
