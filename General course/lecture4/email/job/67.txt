MSc in "Cognitive Science and Natural Language"
in the School of Cognitive Science,
Division of Informatics, University of Edinburgh


The new School of Cognitive Science, in the newly created Division of
Informatics, takes over the teaching and research training activities of the 
former Centre for Cognitive Science. In an act of fundamental restructuring, the 
Centre for Cognitive Science and the Human Communication Research Centre, as 
well as the departments of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, have 
all merged to form the Division of Informatics. In very broad terms, Informatics 
is devoted to studying the structure, behaviour and design of computational, 
cognitive and communicating systems, both natural and artificial.

MSc POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMME

The School of Cognitive Science directly continues the educational heritage of 
the Centre for Cognitive Science, which established its postgraduate programme 
in 1978 and is widely recognized internationally as one of the best programmes 
of it's kind. The School of Cognitive Science offers a course of postgraduate 
study centred on language and cognition.

STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAMME

The specific modules available vary slightly from year to year, but the 
following list of seven contributing disciplines provides an accurate indication 
of the general pattern:

    Cognitive Psychology
    Computational Linguistics
    Data Intensive Linguistics
    Formal Logic
    Logic Programming and Knowledge Representation
    Neural Computation
    Theoretical Linguistics

The teaching is carried out over two ten-week terms, and many of the 
contributing subjects have both first and second term modules. Students are 
expected to take four modules per term for assessment.

Between May and September, MSc students work on a dissertation or project. In 
addition to the first year taught course, there are a number of advanced courses 
available within the Division of Informatics for students working beyond the MSc 
level. Also, there is a rich diversity of research workshops and working groups 
in which PhD students are active participants.

STUDYING IN EDINBURGH

Edinburgh contains the largest concentration of expertise in Artificial 
Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in Europe. Students have access to 
that expertise, to Edinburgh's large copyright libraries, and within Cognitive 
Science, to a substantial offprint library. The School possesses extensive 
computing facilities based on a network of Sun workstations and Apple 
Macintoshes; access to Edinburgh's concurrent supercomputer and other central 
computing services is easily arranged.

Edinburgh, `Athens of the North', is a beautiful Georgian city. Home of the 
International Festival, it is endowed with green parklands and lies close to the 
wildscape of the Scottish Highlands. Edinburgh restaurants offer a wide range of 
ethnic cuisines, and there is a variety of theatres, galleries, museums and 
cinemas.

Applicants typically have undergraduate degrees in one of the participating 
areas or an appropriate joint honours degree.

UK and EU students following the MSc and PhD courses are eligible to apply for 
studentships. SCS will advise all students concerning funding possibilities. SCS 
attracts studentships from a variety of UK and non-UK funding bodies.
