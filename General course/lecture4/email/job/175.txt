POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN AXON GUIDANCE

A postdoctoral position in now available to join a small team of
physicists, biologists and computational neuroscientists investigating
mechanisms of axon guidance in the developing nervous system. We are
combining mathematical modeling with the development of a novel
bioengineering technology for complementary quantitative experiments.
We are looking for someone with skills in mathematical biological
modeling, dynamics of complex systems, or quantitative imaging and
data acquisition. For more details see
