The ideal candidate will have 1+ years experience and possess a B.S. or M.S.degree in neuroscience or related field. I represent a leading biotech firm with research facilities in Baltimore, Maryland and can provide excellent benefits (health insurance, dental, and vision plan, stock options, bonus program, paid vacation and more). A high impact, high profile position with excellent opportunity for advancement.
