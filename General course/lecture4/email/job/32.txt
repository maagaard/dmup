A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY GRADUATE TRAINING PROGRAM

			    in

LEARNING AND ACTION IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY:
COGNITIVE, COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES

Deadline for Applications:  January 1, 1999

Brown University is actively recruiting graduate students for a new
NSF-supported
Interdisciplinary Graduate Education, Research and Training (IGERT)
program in "Learning and Action in the Face of Uncertainty:
Cognitive, Computational and Statistical Approaches".

The use of probabilistic models and statistical methods has
had a major impact on our understanding of language, vision, action, and
reasoning.  This training program provides students with the opportunity to
integrate a detailed study of human or artificial systems for language
acquisition and use, visual processing, action, and reasoning with
appropriate mathematical and computational models.  Students will be enrolled
in one of the three participating departments (Applied Mathematics,
Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, and Computer Science) and will
study an interdisciplinary program of courses in topics such as
statistical estimation, cognitive processes, linguistics, and
computational models.  The aim of this program is to provide promising
students with a mix of mathematical, computational and experimental
expertise to carry out multidisciplinary collaborative research across
the disciplines of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and
Cognitive Science.

Interested students should apply to the participating department
closest to their area of interest and expertise, and should indicate
their interest in the IGERT training program in their application.
Brown University is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.

    A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY POSTDOCTORAL OPPORTUNITY

                                                           in

       LEARNING AND ACTION IN THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY:
  COGNITIVE, COMPUTATIONAL AND STATISTICAL APPROACHES

As part of an NSF award to Brown University through the IGERT program, the
Departments of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, Computer Science, and
Applied Mathematics will be hiring two Postdoctoral Research Associates.
Fellows will be scholars who have displayed significant interest and
ability in conducting collaborative interdisciplinary research in one or
more of the research areas of the program: computational and empirical
approaches to uncertainty in language, vision, action, or human reasoning.
As well as participating in collaborative research, responsibilities will
include helping to coordinate cross-departmental graduate teaching and
research as well as some teaching of interdisciplinary graduate courses.
We expect that these fellows will play an important role in creating a
highly visible presence for the IGERT program at Brown, and their
interdisciplinary activities will help unify the interdepartmental
activities of the IGERT program.

Applicants must hold a PhD in Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Computer
Science, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or a related discipline, or show
evidence that the PhD will be completed before the start of the position.
Applicants should send a vita and three letters of reference to Steven
Sloman, Department of Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences, Brown University,
Box 1978, Providence, RI 02912.  Special consideration will be given to
those applicants whose research is relevant to at least two of the
participating departments. The positions will begin September 1, 1999 for
one year, renewable upon satisfactory  completion of duties in the first
year.  Salaries will be between $35,000 and $45,000 per year. All materials
must be received by Jan. 1, 1999, for full consideration.  Brown University
is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
