GRADUATE STUDENT POSITION

At the PET Center, University Hospital Groningen and University of
Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, a graduate student position 
(for 4 years) is available. The successfull applicant will work in
the methodology group on the development of new non-parametric 
processing and analysis methods for (dynamic) Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) data. In particular the processing and analysis 
of dynamic PET data applying principal component, wavelet and
artificial neural network techniques will be pursued.

TOPICS
- Intelligent temporal filtering of dynamic PET data.
- Automated classification and segmentation of dynamic PET data.
- "Optimal" visualisation of dynamic PET data.
- Input function extraction from output data (i.e. PET).

REQUIREMENTS
  Candidates should have an university degree (M.Sc. or equivalent)
in (applied) physics or (electrical) engineering with an interest in
data-analysis and/or image processing. Experience with one or more 
of the techniques mentioned above or PET is an advantage but not
essential. This position is for 4 years and must result in a Ph.D.
thesis.

INFORMATION
  For further information or to apply for this position contact 
A. Willemsen, Ph.D. (a.t.m.willemsen@pet.azg.nl) or A. Paans, Ph.D.
(a.m.j.paans@pet.azg.nl).
