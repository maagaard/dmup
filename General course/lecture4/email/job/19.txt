Open Faculty Position in Information and Computer Science at UC Irvine
http://www.ics.uci.edu/interfac.html

The Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) has a 
tenure-track position open in the general area of interdisciplinary 
applications of computing. Research emphases include areas such as
computational statistics, scientific data visualization, computer
graphics and animation, computational biology, medical informatics,
information organization, storage, retrieval and visualization.

The available position is at the assistant professor level, but
exceptional candidates from all ranks will be considered. In all cases,
we are looking for applicants with a Ph. D. degree in Computer Science
or a related field, and strong research credentials as evidenced by 
scholarly publications. Applicants for senior positions must also 
demonstrate a proven track record in original research and teaching 
activities.

The ICS Department is organized as an independent campus unit reporting
to the Executive Vice Chancellor. It runs the second most popular 
major at UCI and has designed an undergraduate honors program that 
attracts the campus' most qualified students. ICS faculty are involved
in the forefront of research in the emerging areas of the computer 
science discipline such as multimedia/embedded computing,
knowledge-discovery in databases, bioinformatics and the role of 
information in computer science and society. The faculty has effective 
interdisciplinary ties to colleagues in biology, cognitive science, 
engineering, management, medicine, and the social sciences. The 
Department currently has 32 full-time faculty and 125 Ph.D. students
involved in various research areas including computer science theory, 
artificial intelligence, networks and distributed systems, databases, 
multimedia systems, computer systems design, software/software 
engineering, human-computer interaction and computer-supported 
cooperative work. 

ICS at UC Irvine represents one of the fastest growing departments 
and a computer science program that builds upon our strengths in core
as well as growth areas of computer science. Although UCI is a young
university, it has attained remarkable stature in the past 3 decades. 
Two Nobel prizes were recently awarded to UCI faculty. UCI is located
three miles from the Pacific Ocean near Newport Beach, approximately
forty miles south of Los Angeles. Irvine is consistently ranked among
the safest cities in the U.S. and has an exceptional public school 
system. The campus is surrounded by high-technology companies that
participate in an active affiliates program. Both the campus and the 
area offer exciting professional and cultural opportunities. Mortgage 
and housing assistance are available including newly built, for-sale 
housing located on campus and within short walking distance from the 
department.

Applicants should send a cover letter indicating that they are applying
for the "interdisciplinary applications of computing faculty position,
Position E", a CV, sample papers and contact information for five
references to:
	ICS Faculty Position E 
	c/o Joy Schuler>
	Department of Information and Computer Science
	University of California, Irvine
	Irvine, CA 92697-3425.

Application screening will begin immediately upon receipt of curriculum
vitae. Maximum consideration will be given to applications received 
by December 1, 1998. Salaries commensurate with experience.  The 
University of California is an Equal Opportunity Employer, committed 
to excellence through diversity.
