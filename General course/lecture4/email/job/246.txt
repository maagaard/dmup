I apologize for multiple receipants.

The Brain Science Research Center (BSRC) and Department of
Electrical and Computer Science at Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology have immediate openings for
Research Professor and Post Doc. The Research Professor
position requires at least 1 year experience after Ph.D. degree.

The BSRC is the main research organization for Korean
Brain Science and Engineering Research Program sponsored
by Korean Ministry of Science and Technology. It currently
manages a big national research program, and more than
100 professors throughout Korea are working in the research
program. It is truly multidisciplinary research program,
and ample opertunities exist to cooparate with researchers
in other disciplines, from neuroscisnce to neural network
applications and implementations.

Although all aspects of biological and artificial neural neural
networks are pursued, researchers in the following subjects
have higher priority.

(1) cognitive science (selective attention, etc.)
(2) speech signal processing and recognition
(3) auditory model
(4) neuro-chip implementation
(5) dynamic neural models

WE EMPHASIZE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCHES,
FROM BIOLOGY TO HARDWARE THROUGH MODELING
AND APPLICATIONS.

Interested candidates should contact with
Prof. Soo-Young Lee, Director, BSRC,
at sylee@ee.kaist.ac.kr.
