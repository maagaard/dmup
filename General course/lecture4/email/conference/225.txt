INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON OBJECTIVE BAYESIAN METHODOLOGY
SECOND INFORMATION BULLETIN

1499--1999: Five Centuries of the Universitat de València
Valencia, Spain, June 11th -- June 13th, 1999

The  Universitat of València, Spain, will celebrate
next year its 500 anniversary. Within the Centenary
Programme, the University  of Valencia is sponsoring an
International Workshop on Objective Bayesian Methodology

Objective Bayesian Methodology:

Objective Bayesian methodology is of increasing importance today
for at least two reasons. First, application of Bayesian analysis
is rapidly growing among nonspecialists, most of whom seek
automatic or objective Bayesian procedures. Second, computational
advances have allowed Bayesian methodology to be employed in
problems of such complexity that determination of serious
subjective priors is essentially impossible. The corresponding
explosion of research on objective Bayesian methods makes a
workshop in this area particularly timely.

Objective Bayesian methodology is, for the most part, oriented
towards the development of prior distributions that can be used
automatically, ie that do not require subjective input. There
are three quite distinct statistical domains in which this
development has taken place: parametric estimation, parametric
testing, and nonparametric analysis. The specific topics in these
areas that are currently being considered for the Workshop are
listed below. Note, however, that it is planned to maintain
considerable flexibility so as to be able to include late-breaking
developments.

1. Objective Priors and Frequentist Statistics
2. Determination of Objective Priors in Important Problems
3. Priors for Objective Bayesian Testing and Model Selection
4. Objective Priors in Nonparametric Analysis
5. The Roles of Objective Bayesian Analysis

Workshop Organization:

The three day workshop will take place at the Peset Center, a reconverted
XVIII century palace  in the medieval old
town of the city of Valencia, with appropriate facilities.
