entertainment fields. The ninth IEEE Visualization conference
focuses on interdisciplinary methods. It supports collaboration
among developers and users of visualization methods across all of
science, engineering, medicine, and commerce.

The conference week will include tutorials, symposia, and mini-workshops
Sunday through Tuesday, and papers, panels, case studies, and
late-breaking hot topics presentations Wednesday through Friday. The deadline
for conference and hotel advance registration is September 25th.
