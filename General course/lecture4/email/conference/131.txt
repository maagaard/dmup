MicroNeuro'99
7th International Conference on
Microelectronics for Neural, Fuzzy
and Bio-inspired Systems
Granada, Spain, April 7-9, 1999

MicroNeuro99 is the seventh of a series of international conferences
previously held in Dortmund, Mnchen, Edinburgh, Torino, Lausanne and
Dresden, in each of which around a hundred specialists have participated.
The conference is dedicated to hardware implementations of artificial
neural
networks, fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy systems, and related bio-inspired computing
architectures. The program will focus upon all aspects related to the
hardware implementation of these systems, with special emphasis on specific
VLSI analog, digital and pulse-coded circuits.
