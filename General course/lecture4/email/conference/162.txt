***** CALL FOR PAPERS ***** 

THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE AND NEURAL SYSTEMS 
May 26-29, 1999 

Sponsored by Boston University's
Center for Adaptive Systems
and 
Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems
with financial support from DARPA and ONR 


How Does the Brain Control Behavior?

How Can Technology Emulate Biological Intelligence? 

The conference will include invited tutorials and lectures, and
contributed lectures and posters by experts on the biology and
technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a
changing world. The conference is aimed at researchers and students of
computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science,
artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial
intelligence.

A single oral or poster session enables all presented work to be
highly visible.

Abstract submissions encourage submissions of the latest results. 

Costs are kept at a minimum without compromising the quality of
meeting handouts and social events.

name(s), affiliation(s), mailing, and email address(es) should begin
each Abstract. An accompanying cover letter should include: Full title
of Abstract; corresponding author and presenting author name, address,
telephone, fax, and email address; and a first and second choice from

technological (T) work. Example: first choice: vision (T); second
choice: neural system models (B).  (Talks will be 15 minutes
long. Posters will be up for a full day. Overhead, slide, and VCR
facilities will be available for talks.)  Abstracts which do not meet
these requirements or which are submitted with insufficient funds will
be returned. Accepted Abstracts will be printed in the conference

REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Early registration is recommended.  To
register, please fill out the registration form below.  Student
registrations must be accompanied by a letter of verification from a
department chairperson or faculty/research advisor. If accompanied by
an Abstract or if paying by check, mail to the address above.  If
paying by credit card, mail as above, or fax to (617) 353-7755, or
email to cindy@cns.bu.edu. The registration fee will help to pay for a
