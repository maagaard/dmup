    ABSTRACT: Although the study of visual perception has made more
    progress in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive
    science, there remain major disagreements as to how closely
    vision is tied to cognition. This paper sets out some of the
    arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision,
    neuroscience, Psychophysics, perceptual learning and other areas
    of vision science) and defends the position that an important
    part of visual perception, corresponding to what some people
    have called early vision, is prohibited from accessing relevant
    expectations, knowledge and utilities in determining the
    function it computes - in other words it is cognitively
    impenetrable.  That part of vision is complex and involves
    top-down interactions that are internal to the early vision
    system.  Its function is to provide a structured representation
    of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to serve as an index
    into memory, with somewhat different outputs being made
    available to other systems such as those dealing with motor
    control.  The paper also addresses certain conceptual and
    methodological issues raised by this claim, including the use of
    signal detection theory and event-related potentials to assess
    cognitive penetration of vision.

    A distinction is made among several stages in visual processing.
    These include, in addition to the inflexible early-vision
    stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation stage and a
    post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and inference stage which
    accesses long-term memory. These two stages provide the primary
    ways in which cognition can affect the outcome of visual
    perception.  The paper discusses arguments that have been
    presented in both computer vision and psychology showing that
    vision is "intelligent" and involves elements of "problem
    solving".  It is suggested that the cases of apparently
    intelligent interpretation that are sometimes cited in support
    of this claim do not show cognitive penetration, but rather they
    show that certain natural constraints on interpretation,
    concerned primarily with optical and geometrical properties of
    the world, have been compiled into the visual system.  The paper
    also examines a number of examples where instructions and
    "hints" are alleged to affect what is seen.  In each case it is
    concluded that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the
    view that when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus
    outside early vision, in such processes as the allocation of
    focal attention and identification of the stimulus.
