CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


1997 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics
April 27-30, 1997
Providence, RI
http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/Symp3D.htm


	Extended abstracts due:			Sept. 25, 1996
	Acceptance notification:		Nov. 11, 1996
	Final papers for Proceedings due:	Dec. 18, 1996

The focus of the symposium will be on the frontiers of real-time,
interactive 3D computer graphics and multimedia. The symposium will
consist of formal paper sessions and hands-on demonstrations where
research groups and vendors will demonstrate the state-of-the-art in the
field. Topics of interest for technical sessions and demonstrations
include:

* innovative human-machine interface paradigms for navigating, working
and playing in complex, real-time graphics environments, including
virtual worlds, Web-based systems, and visualization systems;

* high-performance 3D graphics architectures, hardware, and software for
interacting with virtual worlds and teleoperation systems;

* novel sensory I/O devices for "seeing, hearing and feeling in the
virtual world";

* perceptual and psychological issues regarding multimodal interaction
and operation in complex virtual spaces;

* interactive model building tools for shaping, building or sculpting of
objects, and the interactive assembly and manipulation of systems of
parts;

* languages or APIs for specifying geometry and behaviors for interactive
and network based applications;

* algorithms for animating complex reactive characters; authoring tools
for constructing reactive models;

* interactive simulations distributed over local and long-haul networks;

* software for representing, designing, visualizing and interacting with
complex geometry, structure and behavior.


Extended abstracts 3 to 5 pages long describing original work should
reflect the contents of the final paper and the symposium presentation.
Accompanying video tapes where appropriate are strongly recommended.
Performance claims should be supported by actual measurements. Full
explanations of any special techniques necessary to achieve real-time
picture generation and display should be provided. Abstracts should
clearly state what has been achieved and how this makes a contribution to
the state-of-the-art in interactive 3D graphics.

The program committee will review the abstracts and notify the author(s)
whether the paper will be accepted as a short or long paper, and whether
the presentation will be short or long. Short papers will be 4 pages;
long papers may be up to 12 pages.  Short presentations will be 15
minutes; long presentations will be up to 25 minutes.

Attendance will be limited to 250 participants. Places will be reserved
for up to 50 students at reduced registration rates.

CALL FOR ABSTRACTS

SimTecT 97
Advancing Simulation Technology and Training

17-20th March, 1997

Rydges (Lakeside) Hotel,
Canberra, ACT
AUSTRALIA

http://www.cse.rmit.edu.au/simtect


About SimTecT 97

The Simulation Technology and Training Conference (SimTecT 97)
will be held at the Rydges (Lakeside) Hotel, in Canberra, Australia in
March 1997.  This conference will bring together key people from
industry, academia and government agencies to explore current and
future developments in simulation and training.  Until relatively
recently, the benefits of computer-generated environments were only
available to a few highly specialised users.  However, these benefits are
now available not just for the training of specialist skills needed to
control complex systems, but also for training everyday skills, such as
driving a car.

The highly successful SimTecT 96 was held in Melbourne, Australia.
Lt Col Dave Bartlett, one of the keynote speakers from the US Defence
Modelling and Simulation Office (DMSO), said that "it was one of the
best conferences I have attended in the last 10 years".

SimTecT 97 will discuss the way forward in simulation technology and
training, as well as recent innovations which have vastly improved the
technologies used to generate "virtual worlds".  Current developments
in simulation technology include visual displays, computer generated
imagery, C3I, digital battlefield, haptic devices (force feedback), three-
dimensional sound, and software tools enabling complex database and
synthetic environments to be developed easily.  With the dramatic
advances in computing power and the accompanying reductions in
cost, simulation is now being applied in a wide range of expanding
application areas.


Abstract submissions

Authors are invited to submit one page abstracts describing both
theoretical and practical work in any area of simulation technology and
training (including commercial, medical, mining and military areas) by
Friday 27th September, 1996.  Authors whose abstracts are accepted
will be invited to submit full papers by Monday 16th December 1996.
The final papers will be published in the conference proceedings.
Classified papers will not be accepted.  Accepted papers must have
unlimited distribution and made available to conference organisers for
reprinting.  A broader range of topics will be considered (as compared
to SimTecT 96); these include, but are not limited to:

  advanced and prototype systems
  case studies
  commercial accreditation
  commercial/industrial applications
  computer generated forces (CGF)
  databases
  fidelity of visual, motion, auditory and other sensory cues
  interoperability (DIS, HLA, etc.)
  scientific visualisation
  simulator and operator interfaces
  training effectiveness
  training methodologies and transfer
  verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A)
  virtual reality

Abstracts must be received by the conference programme committee
before or on Friday, 27th September, 1996.  Full papers will be required
by Monday 16th December, 1996.  Send all submissions to :
