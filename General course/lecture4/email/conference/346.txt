Thanks to the sponsorship of IEEE Signal Processing Society
and the IEEE Neural Networks Council the tenth of a series of
IEEE workshops on Neural Networks for Signal Processing
will be held at the University of Sydney Campus, Sydney, Australia.
The workshop will feature keynote lectures, technical presentations,
and panel discussions.

Papers are solicited for, but not limited to, the following areas:

Algorithm and Architectures:
Artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive signal processing,
Bayesian modeling, MCMC, generalization, design algorithms,
optimization, parameter estimation, nonlinear signal processing,
Markov models, fuzzy systems (FS), evolutionary computation (EC),
synergistic models of ANN/FS/EC, and wavelets.

Applications:
Speech processing, image processing, sonar and radar, data fusion,
intelligent multimedia and web processing, OCR, robotics, adaptive
filtering,
blind source separation, communications, sensors, system identification,

and other general signal processing and pattern recognition
applications.

Implementations:
Parallel and distributed implementation, hardware design,
and other general implementation technologies.


PAPER SUBMISSION PROCEDURE
Prospective authors are invited to submit a full paper
using the electronic submission procedure described at the workshop
homepage: http://eivind.imm.dtu.dk/nnsp2000

Accepted papers will be published in a hard-bound volume by IEEE
and distributed at the workshop.
