ANNOUNCEMENT / CALL FOR PAPERS

Second International ICSC Symposium on
ENGINEERING OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS / EIS'2000
To be held at the University of Paisley, Scotland, U.K.
June 27-30, 2000

http//www.icsc.ab.ca/eis2000.htm

EIS'2000 is co-sponsored by 
The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE),
The University of Paisley and 
ICSC International Computer Science Conventions


INTRODUCTION

The EIS conference series pursue the synthesis of Artificial Intelligence techniques with
Control Engineering methods to produce Intelligent Systems for Engineering applications. 
In recent years, the combination of Control Engineering and extensive knowledge of AI techniques has allowed scientists and practitioners to make a number of significant 
contributions to this rapidly developing field, for example in qualitative control, 
fuzzy qualitative simulation and model based diagnosis, Artificial Neural Networks 
(ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Fuzzy Logic (FL), and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (NFS).

The EIS conference series intend to provide researchers and practitioners from industry 
and academia with a platform to report on recent developments in the area of intelligent
systems with focus on applications of computational intelligence techniques to 
engineering systems. The meeting will also provide a venue for dialogues between 
software engineers, systems designers and knowledge engineers.

The first very successful conference in the series was held in Tenerife, in February 
1998 and the follow up event will be held in cooperation with the University in Malaga,
Spain, in the year 2002.

THE CITY OF PAISLEY

Paisley has always been colourful. With a population of over 79,000, it is the largest 
town in Scotland, but its scale and character make it a friendly place to study and 
live. Today Paisley is home to a diverse range of modern industries including 
engineering, chemicals, food, oil, microelectronics and computer systems.

Back in the 19th Century, the town’s fame and prosperity came in the shape of 
beautifully patterned Paisley shawls which were made by local weavers and exported 
throughout the world. Paisley’s other main industry of the era was thread-making in 
massive mills that stood along the banks of the River Cart. Today, there’s an 
excellent variety of shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The Lagoon Leisure 
Centre includes saunas, solarium and an Olympic sized ice rink. Regular exhibitions 
and events covering every area of the arts add to the town’s cultural calendar. You 
can enjoy the great outdoors in numerous parks and gardens including the Gleniffer 
Braes Country Park which covers 1300 acres of woodland and moorland.
