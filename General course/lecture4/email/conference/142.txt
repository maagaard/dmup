                          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                 The 29th Carnegie Symposium on Cognition

  Mechanisms of Cognitive Development: Behavioral and Neural Perspectives

                           October 9 - 11, 1998

          James L. McClelland and Robert S. Siegler, Organizers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 29th Carnegie Symposium on Cognition is sponsored by the Department of
Psychology and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. The symposium
is supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of
Mental Heatlh, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This post contains the following entries relevant to the symposium:

   * Overview
   * Schedule of Events
   * Attending the Symposium
   * Travel Fellowships

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview

This symposium will consider how children's thinking evolves during
development, with a focus on the role of experience in causing change.
Speakers will examine the processes by which children learn and those that
make children ready and able to learn at particular points in development,
using both behavioral and neural approaches.

Behavioral approaches will include research on the 'microgenesis' of
cognitive change over short time periods (e.g., several hour-long
sessions) in specific task situations. Research on cognitive change over
longer time scales (months and years) will also be presented, as will
research that uses computational modeling and dynamical systems approaches
to understand learning and development.

Neural approaches will include the study of how neuronal activity and
connectivity change during acquisition of cognitive skills in children
and adults. Other studies will consider the possible emergence of
cognitive abilities through the maturation of brain structures and the
effects of experience on the organization of functions in the brain.
Developmental anomalies such as autism and attention deficit disorder
will also be examined, as windows on normal development.

Four questions will be examined throughout the symposium: 1) Why do
cognitive abilities emerge when they do during development? 2) What
are the sources of developmental and individual differences, and of
developmental anomalies in learning? 3) What happens in the brain when
people learn? 4) How can experiences be ordered and timed so as to
optimize learning?

The answers to these questions have strong implications for how we
educate children and remediate deficits that impede development of
thinking abilities. These implications will be explored in discussions
among the participants.
