               2nd announcement and call for participation
                         Third Sigtuna Workshop
                   Random Events in Biological Systems
                      Sigtuna, Sweden 3-5 Sep 1998
                  organized by the Agora for Biosystems

Objectives
In this meeting we wish to address questions concerning various forms of
fluctuations and disorder in biological systems. By bringing together
experimentalists and theoreticians with knowledge and insights from
different disciplines, such as biology, physics, and computer science,
we hope to shed more light on problems, which we think are profound for
understanding the phenomenon of life. Topics will include
synchronization, oscillations, chaos, noise, and stochastic resonance in
e.g. the origin and evolution of life, biomolecular kinetics, neural
information processing, and organ system functioning. Both experimental
data and theory from the frontiers of science will be discussed.

A number of invited speakers will provide presentations on the
fundamental problems, but we invite further contributions, in the form
of short lectures, computer demonstrations and posters. In order to
maintain a close contact between all participants, and to provide an
efficient workshop atmosphere, the number of participants will be
limited to approximately forty people.

The location of the workshop is at a unique guest house in Sigtuna, a
royal town in the early Middle Ages. Situated at the shore of the
beautiful lake M=E4laren, Sigtuna is only 15 km away from the Stockholm
airport and 45 km from downtown Stockholm. It is also close to the city
of Uppsala. The total cost, including accomodation, all meals and
registration fee is 3000 SEK (approx 375 USD).

Call for submissions:
A small number of contributed talks will be organized. Interested
participants are asked to submit by email a title and abstract to any of
the organizers, by July 15, 1998.
