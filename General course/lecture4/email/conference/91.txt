     Fourth International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference (ICGI-98)
		http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~icgi98/icgi98.html

 Program Co-Chairs: Vasant Honavar and Giora Slutzki Iowa State University

                              July 12-14, 1998
                           Iowa State University
                              Ames, Iowa, USA.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Cosponsored by
         International Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics
                           Iowa State University

                                    and

                            In cooperation with
              American Association for Artificial Intelligence
                 IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society
          ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grammatical Inference, variously refered to as automata induction, grammar
induction, and automatic language acquisition, refers to the process of
learning of grammars and languages from data. Machine learning of grammars
finds a variety of applications in syntactic pattern recognition, adaptive
intelligent agents, diagnosis, computational biology, systems modelling,
prediction, natural language acquisition, data mining and knowledge
discovery.

Traditionally, grammatical inference has been studied by researchers in
several research communities including: Information Theory, Formal
Languages, Automata Theory, Language Acquisition, Computational Linguistics,
Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Computational Learning Theory, Neural
Networks, etc.

Perhaps one of the first attempts to bring together researchers working on
grammatical inference for an interdisciplinary exchange of research results
took place under the aegis of the First Colloquium on Grammatical Inference
held at the University of Essex in United Kingdom in April 1993. This was
followed by the (second) International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference,
held at Alicante in Spain, the proceedings of which were published by
Springer-Verlag as volume 862 of the Lectures Notes in Artificial
Intelligence, and the Third International Colloquium on Grammatical
Inference, held at Montpellier in France, the proceedings of which were
published by Springer-Verlag as volume 1147 of the Lecture Notes in
Artificial Intelligence. Following the success of these events and the
Workshop on Automata Induction, Grammatical Inference, and Language
Acquisition, held in conjunction with the International Conference on
Machine Learning at Nashville in United States in July 1997, the Fourth
International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference will be held from July 12
through July 14, 1998, at Iowa State University in United States.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conference seeks to provide a forum for presentation and discussion of
original research papers on all aspects of grammatical inference including,
but not limited to:

   * Different models of grammar induction: e.g., learning from examples,
     learning using examples and queries, incremental versus non-incremental
     learning, distribution-free models of learning, learning under various
     distributional assumptions (e.g., simple distributions), impossibility
     results, complexity results, characterizations of representational and
     search biases of grammar induction algorithms.
   * Algorithms for induction of different classes of languages and
     automata: e.g., regular, context-free, and context-sensitive languages,
     interesting subsets of the above under additional syntactic
     constraints, tree and graph grammars, picture grammars,
     multi-dimensional grammars, attributed grammars, parameterized models,
     etc.
   * Theoretical and experimental analysis of different approaches to
     grammar induction including artificial neural networks, statistical
     methods, symbolic methods, information-theoretic approaches, minimum
     description length, and complexity-theoretic approaches, heuristic
     methods, etc.
   * Broader perspectives on grammar induction -- e.g., acquisition of
     grammar in conjunction with language semantics, semantic constraints on
     grammars, language acquisition by situated agents and robots,
     acquisition of language constructs that describe objects and events in
     space and time, developmental and evolutionary constraints on language
     acquisition, etc.
   * Demonstrated or potential applications of grammar induction in natural
     language acquisition, computational biology, structural pattern
     recognition, information retrieval, text processing, adaptive
     intelligent agents, systems modelling and control, and other domains.
