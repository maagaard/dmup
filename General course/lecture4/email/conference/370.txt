Dear connectionists,

I am organizing two special sessions for the KES2000 conference. The 
conference will take place from August 30 to September 1, 2000 in 
Brighton, Sussex, U.K. More information on the conference can be
obtained from the KES2000 Web site: 
              
                 http://luna.bton.ac.uk/~kes2000/

The topics of the sessions are:

1) Processing of hierarchical structures in neural networks.
2) Biomedical applications of neural networks.

Accepted session contributions will be published in the conference 
proceedings by IEEE.

The procedure for submissions is as follows:

1) Please send me a short statement concerning the topic of
   your intended contribution BEFORE FEBRUARY 04, 2000. 

   This statement may contain a title and a short abstract and 
   should not exceed half a page.
   
   Based on these statements we may further focus the topics
   of the two workshops.

   I will send out a call for papers ON FEBRUARY 11, 2000.

2) Send the camera ready version of your paper (four A4 pages)
   UNTIL MARCH 15, 2000.

   The papers will be reviewd and the results will be
   communicated to the authors in APRIL, 2000.
