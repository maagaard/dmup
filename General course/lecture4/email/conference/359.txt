SESSION INFORMATION:

**************************************************************************
Artificial neural networks are increasingly being incorporated as
components or subsystems of higher-order systems.  These systems may
represent ensembles of neural networks, fuzzy-neural systems,
neural-genetic systems, or other such hybrid intelligent systems intended
for classification, prediction, model selection, analysis, data mining or
control.  This session is open to neural network architectures,
algorithms, applications, and tools that contribute to or provide a
framework for interfacing ANNs with larger intelligent systems.

***************************************************************************

GENERAL INFORMATION:

The IC-AI'2000 will be held simultaneously (same location and dates)
with The International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Processing
Techniques and Applications (PDPTA) and The International Conference on
Imaging Science, Systems, and Technology (CISST).

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

      Prospective authors are invited to submit three copies of their
      draft paper (about 4 pages) to the session chair, Dr. R.S. Renner,
      by the due date:
		R.S. Renner
		California State University, Chico
		Department of Computer Science
		Chico, CA   95929-0410, U.S.A.
		Tel: (530) 898-5419
		Fax: (530) 898-5995
		E-mail: renner@ecst.csuchico.edu

      E-mail and Fax submissions are also acceptable.  
      The length of the Camera-Ready papers (if accepted)
      will be limited to 7 pages.  Papers must not have been
      previously published or currently submitted for publication
      elsewhere.

      The first page of the draft paper should include: title of the
      paper, name, affiliation, postal address, E-mail address,
      telephone number, and Fax number for each author.  The first

      the topical area.  The Camera-Ready papers will be reviewed by
      one person.


PUBLICATION:

      The conference proceedings will be published by CSREA Press
      (ISBN).  The proceedings will be available at the conference.
      Some accepted papers will also be considered for journal
      publication (soon after the conference).
      

ORGANIZERS/SPONSORS:

      A number of university faculty members and their staff
      in cooperation with the Monte Carlo Resort (Conference Division,
      Las Vegas ), will be organizing the conference.  The conference

      the Computer Vision Research and Applications Tech., ...)


LOCATION OF CONFERENCE:

      The conference will be held in the Monte Carlo Resort
      hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.  This is a mega hotel
      with excellent conference facilities and over 3000 rooms.
      The hotel is minutes from the Las Vegas airport with free
      shuttles to and from the airport.  This hotel has many
      vacation and recreational attractions, including:
      waterfalls, casino, spa, pools & kiddie pools, sunning decks,
      Easy River water ride, wave pool with cascades, lighted
      tennis courts, health spa (with workout equipment, whirlpool,
      sauna, ...), arcade virtual reality game rooms, nightly
      shows, snack bars, a number of restaurants, shopping
      area, bars, ...  Many of these attractions are open 24
      hours a day and most are suitable for families and children.
      The negotiated hotel's room rate for conference attendees
      is very reasonable (79USD + tax) per night (no extra charge
      for double occupancy) for the duration of the conference.

      The hotel is within walking distance from most other
      Las Vegas attractions (major shopping areas, recreational
      destinations, fine dining and night clubs, free street
      shows, ...).
      For the benefit of our international colleagues: the state of
      Nevada neighbors with the states of California, Oregon, Idaho,
      Utah, and Arizona.  Las Vegas is only a few driving hours away
      from other major cities, including: Los Angeles, San Diego,
      Phoenix, Grand Canyon, ...


EXHIBITION:

      An exhibition is planned for the duration of the conference.
      We have reserved 20+ exhibit spaces.  Interested parties
      should contact H. R. Arabnia (address is given below).
      All exhibitors will be considered to be the co-sponsors
      of the conference.
