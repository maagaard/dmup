PLEASE DISTRIBUTE THIS MESSAGE TO YOUR COLLEAGUES

I would like to draw your attention to

Photonics Taiwan '98 conference on I/O and Imaging Technology,
July 9-11, 1998, Taipei, Taiwan.


On-site Proceedings.  Abstracts for this conference are due by 1 December
1997. Manuscripts are due by 20 April 1998.

Conference Chairs: Y. Tim Tsai, Industrial Technology Research Institute
(Taiwan); Teh-Ming Kung, Eastman Kodak Co. (USA); Jan Larsen, Technical
Univ. of Denmark (Denmark)

Program Committee: Tulay Adali, Univ. of Maryland/Baltimore County (USA);
Yung-Chang Chen, National Tsing Hua Univ. (Taiwan); King-Lung Huang,
Industrial Technology Research Institute (Taiwan); Jenq-Neng Hwang, Univ.
of Washington (USA); Jim Z. Lai, Feng-Chia Univ. (Taiwan); Yawcheng Lo,
Eastman Kodak Co. (USA); Sethuraman Panchanathan, Arizona State Univ.
(USA); Soo C. Pei, National Taiwan Univ. (Taiwan); Jing X. Sun, Lexmark
International, Inc. (USA); Ming-Ting Sun, Univ. of Washington (USA);
Han-Chung Wang, Industrial Technology Research Institute (Taiwan); James F.
Wang, Xerox Wilson Ctr. for Research and Technology (USA)

The goal of this conference is to explore the input, output, and imaging
technologies for digital systems. Over the year, the I/O interfaces have
been improved in many aspects: from B/W to color, from text to imaging,
etc. The higher quality is not only desired, but also requested.
Dissemination of these applications, developed techniques, and their
effectiveness through a centralized medium is necessary.

Papers are solicited in all relevant areas including:
* image capturing systems: scanners, cameras, and systems
* image output systems: inkjet, thermal, and EP printers
* color imaging: color vision models, image processing
* human vision and data visualization
* vision-based algorithms for video and still images
* real-time architecture for I/O devices and image processing.
