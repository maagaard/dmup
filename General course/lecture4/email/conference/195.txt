LEARNING IN GRAPHICAL MODELS

Michael I. Jordan, Ed.

Graphical models, a marriage between probability theory and graph
theory, provide a natural tool for dealing with two problems that occur
throughout applied mathematics and engineering--uncertainty and
complexity.  In particular, they play an increasingly important role in
the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.  Fundamental to
the idea of a graphical model is the notion of modularity: a complex
system is built by combining simpler parts.  Probability theory serves
as the glue whereby the parts are combined, ensuring that the system as
a whole is consistent and providing ways to interface models to data.
Graph theory provides both an intuitively appealing interface by which
humans can model highly interacting sets of variables and a data
structure that lends itself naturally to the design of efficient
general-purpose algorithms.
