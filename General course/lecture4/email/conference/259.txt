                            COLT '99
      Twelfth ACM Conference on Computational Learning Theory
            Tuesday, July 6 through Friday, July 9, 1999
         University of California, Santa Cruz, California

The workshop will be held on campus, which is hidden away in the redwoods 
on the Pacific Coast of Northern California.  The workshop is in 
cooperation with the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and 
Computation Theory (SIGACT) and the ACM Special Interest Group on 
Artificial Intelligence (SIGART).

  1. Flight tickets: San Jose Airport is the closest, about a 45
minute drive.   San Francisco Airport (SFO) is about an hour and 
forty-five minutes away, but has slightly better flight connections.

  2. Transportation from the airport to Santa Cruz:
The first option is to rent a car and drive south from San Jose on
Hwy 880, which becomes Hwy 17 or from San Francisco take either Hwy
280 or 101 to Hwy 17.  When you get to Santa Cruz, take
Route 1 (Mission St.) north.  Turn right on Bay Street and follow
the signs to UCSC.  Commuters must purchase parking permits for $4.00/day
M-F (parking is free Saturday and Sunday) from the information kiosk at
the Main entrance to campus or the conference satellite office.  Those 
staying on campus can pick up permits with their room keys.  Various van 
services also connect Santa Cruz with the the San Francisco and San Jose 
airports.  The Santa Cruz Airporter (831) 423-1214 (or (800) 497-4997 
from anywhere) has regularly scheduled trips (every two hours from 9am 
until 11pm from San Jose International Airport ($30 each way), and 
every two hours from 8am until 10pm from SFO, ($35 each way) from either 
airport. ABC Transportation (831) 464-8893 
((800) 734-4313 from California (24hr.)) runs a private sedan service 
($47 for one, $57 for two, $67 for three to six from San Jose Airport 
to UC Santa Cruz, $79 for one, $89 for two, and $99 for three to six 
from SFO to UCSC, additional $10 after 11:30 pm, additional $20 to 
meet an international flight) and will drop you off at your room. Book 
at least 24 hours in advance.

  3. Conference and room registration:
Please fill out the enclosed form and send it to us with your payment.
It must be postmarked by June 1 and received by June 5 to obtain the 
early registration rate and guarantee the room.  Conference housing is 
limited by the available space, and late registrants may need to 
seek off-campus accommodations.

Your arrival: This year we will be at the Kresge apartments.
Enter the campus at the Main Entrance, which is the intersection of 
High and Bay Streets. (Look for the COLT signs.) Bay St. turns 
into Coolidge Dr., continue on this road, which becomes McLaughlin Dr.,
until you reach the stop sign at the T in the road, turn left onto Heller 
Dr., and then you will make a right turn into the Kresge East Apts 
parking lot.  Housing registration will be at the Kresge East Apts 
parking lot from 2:00 to 4:00 pm on Monday.  Keys, meal cards, parking 
permits, maps, and information about what to do in Santa Cruz will be 
available.  The office will remain open until 10:00 pm for late arrivals.  
Arrivals after 10:00 pm:  stop at the Main Entrance Kiosk and have 
the guard call the College Proctor, who will meet you at the Satellite 
Office and give you your housing materials.  Please be prepared to show 
I.D. or you will not be permitted on campus.  Problems?  Please go 
directly to the Kresge Satellite Office, or contact the Conference 
Director at (831) 459-2611.  The Kresge College Conference Office is 
located in Apt. Building R11-Apt 1111.  From the Kresge East Apts 
parking lot continue on Heller Dr. to the Porter College entrance, 
turn right into Porter College, follow the road around (curving right) 
to Kresge College.  At Kresge College, park in the first lot on your 
left and look for signs for the Conference Office. Please do not park 
in spaces with posted restrictions at any time.  In case of emergency, 
dial 911 from any campus phone.

The weather in July is mostly sunny with occasional summer fog.  Even 
though the air may be cool, the sun can be deceptively strong; those 
susceptible to sunburn should come prepared with sunblock.  Bring 
T-shirts, slacks, shorts, and a sweater or light jacket, as it cools 
down at night. For information on the local bus routes and schedules, 
call the Metro Center at (831) 425-8600.

Bring swimming trunks, tennis rackets, etc. You can get day
passes for $5.00 (East Field House, Physical Education Office) 
to use the recreation facilities on campus.

For questions about registration or accommodations, contact  
COLT'99, Computer Science Dept., UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA  95064.  
The e-mail address is colt99@cse.ucsc.edu, and fax is (831)459-4829.
For emergencies, call (831)459-2263.

4. General Conference Information:
The Conference Registration will be at 8:30 Tuesday, outside the 
Porter dining hall.  Late registrations will be at the same location 
during the technical sessions.  All lectures will be in the Porter 
dining hall.  A banquet will be held Tuesday from 6:30--8:00pm
outside the Porter dining hall.

The workshop has been organized to allow time for informal discussion
and collaboration.
