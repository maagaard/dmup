IEE COLLOQUIUM ON APPLIED STATISTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION

Tuesday, 20 April 1999
to be held at The Midlands Engineering Centre, Birmingham, UNITED KINGDOM

Professional Group E5 (Signal processing)
and the Pattern & Information Processing Group, DERA Malvern, United Kingdom

The innovative application of advanced pattern recognition techniques is 
increasingly required to achieve the high levels of performance demanded by 
modern systems. It is therefore vital for engineers and  scientists to develop 
their awareness and understanding of emerging and established  techniques, and
of their successful application.

This colloquium will provide a focus for applied research in this area, drawing
contributions both from industry and academia. It will increase awareness of 
developing techniques across a broad range of applications  areas; and will be
of interest to people working in all areas of statistical pattern recognition,
addressing applications drawn (for example) from signal and image processing.

A number of invited papers will be presented by leading researchers: some of 
these will take the form of illustrative tutorial sessions. Additional 
contributions are welcome, and a one page synopsis of  proposed papers should 
be sent by Friday, 15 January 1999 to:

Dr Amanda Goode
