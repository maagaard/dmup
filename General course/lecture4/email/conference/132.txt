                                  EMMCVPR'99

                       Second International Workshop on
   
                        ENERGY MINIMIZATION METHODS IN
                   COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
 
 
                       York, England, July 26-29, 1999
 
_______________________________________________________________________________
 
 
Energy minimization methods represent a fundamental methodology in computer
vision and pattern recog- nition, with roots in such diverse disciplines as
Physics, Psychology, and Statistics. Recent manifestations of the idea include
Markov random fields, relaxation labeling, various types of neural networks, etc. 
These techniques are finding application in areas such as early vision, graph
matching, motion analysis, visual reconstruction, etc. This workshop is the
second in a series that aims to consolidate research efforts in this area, and 
to provide a discussion forum for researchers and practitioners interested in
this important yet diverse subject. The scientific program of the workshop will
include the presentation of invited talks and contributed research papers.
The workshop is sponsored by the International Association for Pattern
Recognition (IAPR) and organized by the Department of Computer Science of the
University of York. 
 
Topics
 
Papers covering (but not limited to) the following topics are solicited:
 
Theory: (e.g., Bayesian contextual methods, a discrete optimization, information
theory and statistics, learning and parameter estimation, Markov random fields,
neural networks, relaxation processes, statistical mechanics approaches, 
stochastic methods, variational methods) 
 
Methodology: (e.g., deformable models, ea
rly vision, matching, motion, object recognition, shape, stereo, texture,
visual organization) 
 
Applications: (e.g., character and text recognition, face processing,
handwriting, medical imaging, remote sensing)

     E-mail: erh@cs.york.ac.uk
 
The manuscripts submitted should be no longer than 15 pages, and the cover page
should contain: title, author's name, affiliation and address, e-mail address,
fax and telephone number, and an abstract no longer than 200 words. In case 
of joint authorship, the first name will be used for correspondence unless
otherwise requested. All manuscripts will be reviewed by at least two members of
the program committee. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will 
again be published in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science by Springer-
Verlag, and will be distributed to all participants at the workshop. In order to
get a high-quality book with a uniform and professional appearance, prospective
authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX style file available at the
WWW site indicated below.
