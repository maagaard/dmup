			Self-learning robots III
	Brainstyle robotics: The cerebellum beyond function approximation 
	http://www.robotic.dlr.de/Smagt/workshop/iee99.html

	A Workshop organised by Professional Group A9 (Neural computing)
	Monday 15 February 1999, Savoy Place, London, UK

	workshop co-organiser

Throughout the years there has been extensive research in the structure
and working of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is a part of the brain of
vertebrates that is well understood in various aspects:

The cerebellum is used for the spatial motor coordination of fast
movements.  High precision of the movement is an important issue.  The
structure of the cerebellum is well-understood: the cells as well as
their connections are known. Also the connections to the other parts of
the brain and spine are understood.  The learning process is
well-understood since 1992.

The 'traditional' neural approach for robot control typically consists
of some form of function approximation. We gather a large amount of
learning samples, and try to represent those as well as possible with
some (universal or specialized) approximator. The major differences lie
there where the choice of approximator is concerned.

Does the cerebellum do something different? 

Many special issues and workshops focusing on brain models for robot
control reflect the increased attention of the development of
cerebellar models. But what can we expect of such models in the
future?  Is the cerebellum is 'just' a function approximator, and can
we mimic its functionality using other models?

In this workshop we will focus on 'working' models of the cerebellum;
how far have we come? Can real applications be expected in the near
future? Can cerebellar models do better than others? Are brainstyle
robotics something to expect in the near future?
