    ABSTRACT: It is hypothesized following much work in linguistic 
    theory that the language faculty has a modular structure  and
    consists of two basic components, a lexicon of  (structured)
    entries and a computational system of combinatorial operations
    to form larger linguistic expressions from lexical entries.
    This target article provides evidence for the dual  nature of
    the language faculty by describing some recent results from a
    multidisciplinary investigation of German  inflection. We have
    examined (i) its linguistic representation focussing on noun
    plurals and verb inflection (participles), (ii) processes
    involved in the way adults produce and comprehend inflected
    words, (iii) brain potentials generated during the processing
    of inflected words and (iv) the way children acquire and use
    inflection. It will be shown that  the evidence from all these
    sources converges and  supports the distinction between lexical
    entries and combinatorial operations.

    Our experimental results indicate that adults have access to
    two distinct processing routes, one accessing (irregularly)
    inflected entries from the mental lexicon, and another 
    involving morphological decomposition of (regularly)  inflected
    words into stem+affix representations. These two processing
    routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic
    system. Results from event-related potentials confirm this
    linguistic distinction at the level of brain structures.  In
    children's language, we found these two processes also to be
    clearly dissociated; regular and irregular inflection are  used
    under different circumstances, and the constraints  under which
    children apply them are identical to those of the adult
    linguistic system.

    Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model,
    which maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the
    computational system, but replaces the traditional view  of the
    lexicon as a simple list of idiosyncrasies with  the notion of
    internally structured lexical representations.

    KEYWORDS: grammar, psycholinguistics, neuroscience of language, child
    language acquisition, human language processing, development of
    inflection

         ***  FIVE IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS  ***

------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) There have been some very important developments in the 
    area of Web archiving of scientific papers very recently.
    Please see:

Science:
           http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/science.html
Nature:
           http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/nature.html
American Scientist:
           http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/amlet.html
Chronicle of Higher Education:
           http://www.chronicle.com/free/v45/i04/04a02901.htm

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) All authors in the biobehavioral and cognitive sciences are
    strongly encouraged to archive all their papers (on their
    Home-Servers as well as) on CogPrints:

http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/

    It is extremely simple to do so and will make all of our papers
    available to all of us everywhere at no cost to anyone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) BBS has a new policy of accepting submissions electronically.

    Authors can specify whether they would like their submissions
    archived publicly during refereeing in the BBS under-refereeing
    Archive, or in a referees-only, non-public archive.

    Upon acceptance, preprints of final drafts are moved to the
    public BBS Archive:

ftp://ftp.princeton.edu/pub/harnad/BBS/.WWW/index.html
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/Archive/

--------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) BBS has expanded its annual page quota and is now appearing
    bimonthly, so the service of Open Peer Commentary can now be be
    offered to more target articles. The BBS refereeing procedure is
    also going to be considerably faster with the new electronic
    submission and processing procedures. Authors are invited to submit
    papers to:

    Email:   bbs@cogsci.soton.ac.uk

    Web:     http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk
             http://bbs.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS:

http://www.princeton.edu/~harnad/bbs/instructions.for.authors.html
http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/bbs/instructions.for.authors.html      

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Call for Book Nominations for BBS Multiple Book Review

    In the past, Behavioral and Brain Sciences (BBS) journal had only
    been able to do 1-2 BBS multiple book treatments per year, because
    of our limited annual page quota. BBS's new expanded page quota
    will make it possible for us to increase the number of books we
    treat per year, so this is an excellent time for BBS Associates and
    biobehavioral/cognitive scientists in general to nominate books you
    would like to see accorded BBS multiple book review.

    (Authors may self-nominate, but books can only be selected on the
    basis of multiple nominations.) It would be very helpful if you
    indicated in what way a BBS Multiple Book Review of the book(s) you
    nominate would be useful to the field (and of course a rich list of
    potential reviewers would be the best evidence of its potential
    impact!).
