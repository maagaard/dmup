Demonstration Proposals (due June 15, 1999)

Visualization '99 is a unique opportunity to present your products or
research to visualization experts from a wide variety of fields. We
invite demonstrations of commercial hardware, software, integrated
systems, peripherals, literature, as well as academic research. We
encourage demonstrators to have technical representatives in
attendance. For more information on participating in Visualization '99
demonstrations, contact Upul Obeysekare at obey@ctc.com


Creative Applications Lab (due July 15, 1999)

The Creative Applications Lab (CAL) is designed to let Visualization
