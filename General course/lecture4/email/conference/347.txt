ANTS'2000 - From Ant Colonies to Artificial Ants: Second International
Workshop on Ant Algorithms

Brussels, Belgium, September 8-9, 2000

CALL FOR EXTENDED ABSTRACTS (up-to-date information on the workshop
is maintained at http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~ants/ants2000/)

SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP

The behavior of social insects in general, and of ant colonies in
particular, has since long time fascinated researchers in ethology and
animal behavior, who have proposed many models to explain their
capabilities.  Recently, ant algorithms have been proposed as a novel
computational model that replaces the traditional emphasis on control,
preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy,
emergence, and distributed functioning.  These designs are proving
flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments
and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail.  

A particularly successful research direction in ant algorithms, known
as "ant colony optimization", is dedicated to their application to
discrete optimization problems. Ant colony optimization has been
applied successfully to a large number of difficult combinatorial
problems like the quadratic assignment and the traveling salesman
problems, to routing in telecommunications networks, to scheduling
problems, and so on.  ANTS'2000 is the second edition of the only
event entirely devoted to ant algorithms and to ant colony
optimization. Also of great interest to the workshop are models of ant
colonies behavior which could stimulate new algorithmic approaches.

The aims are to give researchers in both real ants behavior and in ant
colony optimization an opportunity to meet, to present their latest
research, and to discuss current developments and applications.  The
two-day event will be held in Brussels, Belgium, from September 8 to
September 9, 2000. In the evening of September 7 there will be a
tutorial on ant algorithms.


RELEVANT RESEARCH AREAS

Submissions are invited that describe: 

(1) Models of aspects of real ant colonies behavior that can stimulate
new algorithmic approaches,

(2) Empirical and theoretical research in ant algorithms and ant
colony optimization.

(3) Application of ant algorithms and ant colony optimization methods
to real-world problems.

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Papers can be submitted either as extended abstracts or as full
papers. The length should be of approximately 4 or 10 pages
respectively.

Formatting and submission instructions are provided at
http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~ants/ants2000/ants2000-submission.html.

Accepted papers will be published in a booklet that is to be
distributed to workshop participants.  We are now investigating the
possibility of publishing the best papers as a journal special issue.
In this case, a further call for full papers, that may be longer than
the 10 pages workshop format, will be released.

All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop as
oral presentations or as a poster.


REGISTRATION AND FURTHER INFORMATION

Up-to-date information about the workshop will be made available at
the ANTS'2000 web site (http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~ants/ants2000/).
For information about local arrangements, registration forms, etc.,
please refer to the above mentioned web site, or contact the local
organizer at the address below. 

A registration fee of BF 7,000 will cover local organization expenses,
coffee breaks, and a social dinner on Friday 8 evening.  PhD students
reduced registration fee: BF 6,000. A proof of inscription is 
required in that case.
