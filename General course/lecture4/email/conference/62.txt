		       CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

NATO Advanced Study Institute on "Signal Processing for Multimedia"

                           5-18 July 1998
              Il Ciocco Resort Hotel, Tuscany, Italy


Advances in signal processing and applied mathematics, with the common
aim of improved multimedia performance, are continuing. There is a need
to promote further interaction between these two intimately related
disciplines, in order to ensure that young scientists in each area are
aware of activity in the other, and to see that opportunities for
significant co-developments are not missed. A major purpose of this ASI
will be to effect such interaction.

The two week tutorial program will be presented by the following
distinguished lecturers:

  Les Atlas, University of Washington
    "Representing variations in acoustic signals for military and
    speech applications"

  John Benedetto, University of Maryland
    "Mathematics for multimedia signal processing, I"

  Jan Biemond, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands
    "Video processing"

  Ezio Biglieri, Politecnico di Torino, Italy
    "Digital communication over the wireless channel, today and
    tomorrow"

  Jim Byrnes, Prometheus Inc. and University of Massachusetts/Boston
    "Energy spreading transforms for robust data compression and
    transmission"

  Pierre Duhamel, ENST, France
    "Joint source-channel coding"

  Paulo Ferreira, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal
    "Mathematics for multimedia signal processing, II"
    and
    "Interpolation methods applied to telecommunication problems"

  Stephane Jaffard, University of Paris XII, France
    "Analysis of multifractal signals"

  Vasilis Mertzios, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece
    "Pattern recognition"
    and
    "Applications of pattern recognition to telemedicine and
    human-machine interaction"

  Stig Mjolsnes, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway
    "Secure digital payments and other internet commercial
    transactions"

  Peter Noll, Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany
    "Wideband audio"

  Tor Ramstad, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway
    "Robust image and video communication for mobile multimedia"
    and
    "Mobile multimedia"

  Manfred Schroeder, Universitaet Goettingen, Germany
    "Speech processing"

  Thomas Sikora, Heinrich Hertz Institut, Berlin, Germany
    "Standards for multimedia"

  Andy Tescher, Lockheed Martin
    "An overview of signal processing for multimedia, from the
    past to the future"

  Bruno Torresani, Centre de Physique Theorique, Marseille, France
    "Time-frequency and time-scale transforms"


All talks will be designed to address an audience which will consist of
a broad spectrum of signal processing engineers and mathematicians
involved in these fields. Thus, the participants will have the
opportunity to interact with those individuals who have been on the
forefront of the tremendous expansion in multimedia signal processing in
recent years, to learn firsthand the basics of this exciting area, and
to hear these experts discuss in accessible terms their contributions
and ideas for future research.

WHO CAN ATTEND
Scientists and/or research students of all nationalities, who have
either specialized in the field or who have an appropriate advanced
scientific background. Attendance is limited to 85 besides the 15
lecturers and is subject to approval of application.

WHERE TO SEND YOUR APPLICATION
Both to participate and to request financial support, you must apply to
the Director, Jim Byrnes, via email: asi@cs.umb.edu (please send plain
(ASCII) text only).

WHAT TO SEND
There are two possibilities based on your situation: 
1. If one of the lecturers knows you, (see the lecture schedule) please
ask them to write a very brief recommendation and email it to the
Director. 
2. If none of the lecturers knows you please email to the Director: a
one-paragraph description of yourself, a one-paragraph explanation of
why you would like to attend, and a statement that you intend to 
participate for the full two weeks.

In addition, if you would like to be considered for a poster session
presentation, please send a proposed title and a brief abstract,

BY WHEN TO SEND IT
Send applications to participate and for financial aid as well as
particulars of proposed poster presentations by March 15, 1998. 

WHEN YOU WILL KNOW OUR DECISION
We will email our decisions to you by March 31, 1998.


Further information about the meeting is available on the Worldwide Web
at http://www.cs.umb.edu/~asi/

Please forward this announcement to any of your colleagues who could
benefit from this ASI.

If you or your institution are interested in demonstrating your technology
at the ASI, or in becoming an ASI sponsor, please contact the ASI director
(asi@cs.umb..edu)
