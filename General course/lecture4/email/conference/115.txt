Research Assistant in Neural and Intelligent Systems

(reference number CIRG28)

Applications are invited for a three year research assistant
position in the School of Computing and Information Systems
investigating the development of hybrid neural/symbolic techniques
for intelligent processing. This is an exciting new project which
aims at developing new environments for integrating neural networks
and symbolic processing. You will play a key role in the development
of such hybrid subsymbolic/symbolic environments. It is intended
to apply the developed hybrid environments in areas such as natural
language processing, intelligent information extraction, or the
integration of speech/language in multimedia applications.

You should have a degree in a computing discipline and will be
able to register for a higher degree. A demonstrated interest in
artificial neural networks, software engineering skills and
programming experience are essential (preferably including a subset
of C, C++, CommonLisp, Java, GUI). Experience and interest in neural
network software and simulators would be an advantage (e.g. Planet,
SNNS, Tlearn, Matlab, etc). Salary is according to the researcher A
scale (currently up to  13,871, under revision).

Application forms and further particulars are available from the
Personnel department under +44 191 515 and extensions 2055, 2429,
2054, 2046, or 2425 or E-Mail employee.recruitment@sunderland.ac.uk
quoting the reference number CIRG28.

For informal inquiries please contact Professor Stefan Wermter,
e-mail: Stefan.Wermter@sunderland.ac.uk. Closing date:  10 July 1998.
The successful candidate is expected to start the job as soon as
possible.
