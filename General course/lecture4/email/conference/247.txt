SOFSEM (SOFtware   SEMinar) is  an  eight-day  international  conference
devoted to the theory and the practice of  software systems. Its program
consists of  a series  of  invited  talks  given by  prominent  academic
professionals   and researchers.    Contributed  talks   and posters  of
participants are also included  in the program  of SOFSEM.  The  working
language is English.

                   -------------------------------
Invited talks and contributed talks are published by Springer-Verlag in
the  "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" series and distributed at the
seminar.


+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Sofsem'99 is the 26th in the series of Sofsem seminars held
annually.|
 | It is intended to foster cooperation among people working in various
|
 |   areas of computer science. Its scientific program offers a unique 
|
 |       opportunity to gain a relatively quick and representative     
|
 |        overview about the selected parts of computer science,       
|
 |                    presented by top researchers.                    
|
 |   Its social program provides an optimum framework for discussions, 
|
 |  meetings, establishing contacts, and socializing. Especially suited
|
 |                 for young computer scientists.
