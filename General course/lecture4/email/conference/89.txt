International Summer School  ``Neural Nets E. R. Caianiello"

3rd Course


                "A Course on Speech Processing,
                 Recognition, and Artificial
                 Neural Networks"


web page: http://wsfalco.ing.uniroma1.it/Speeschool.html


The school is jointly organized  by:

INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES (IIASS)
Vietri sul Mare (SA) Italy,

ETTORE MAJORANA FOUNDATION AND CENTER FOR SCIENTIFIC CULTURE (EMFCSC)
Erice (TR), Italy

Supported by:

EUROPEAN SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (ESCA)

Sponsored by:

SALERNO UNIVERSITY, Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche E.R. Caianiello
(Italy)

DIRECTORS OF THE COURSE                 DIRECTORS OF THE SCHOOL
AND ORGANIZING COMMITTEE:

Gerard Chollet (France).                Maria Marinaro  (Italy)
M. Gabriella Di Benedetto (Italy)       Michael Jordan  (USA)
Anna Esposito  (Italy)
Maria Marinaro (Italy)

 

PLACE: International Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies (IIASS)
       Via Pellegrino 19, 84019 Vietri sul Mare, Salerno  (Italy)

DATES: 5th-14th October  1998


POETIC TOUCH

Vietri (from "Veteri", its ancient Roman name) sul Mare ("on sea")
is located within walking distance from Salerno and marks the
beginning of the Amalfi coast. Short rides take to Positano, Sorrento,
Pompei, Herculaneum, Paestum, Vesuvius, or by boat, the islands of
Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Velia (the ancient "Elea" of Zeno and
Parmenide) is a hundred kilometers farther down along the coast.

 

Student Fee:        1500 dollars

Student fee include accommodations (arranged by the school),
meals, one day of excursion, and a copy of the proceedings of
the school.  Transportation is not included.  A few scholarships
are available for students who are otherwise unable
to participate at the school, and who cannot apply for
the grants offered by ESCA.
The scholarship will partially cover lodging and living expenses.

Day time:            3 hour in the morning, three hour in the afternoon.
                      
Day free:            One day with an excursion of the places around.



AIMS:


        The aim of this school is to present the experiments,
        the theories and the perspectives of acoustic phonetics,
        as well as to discuss recent results in the speech literature.
        The school aims to provide a background for further
        study in many of the fields related to speech science
        and linguistics, including automatic speech recognition.
        The school will bring together leading researchers
        and selected students in the field of speech science
        and technology to discuss and disseminate the latest techniques.
        The school is devoted to an international audience and
        in particular to all students and scientists who are
        working on some aspects of speech and want to learn other
        aspects of this discipline.


MAJOR TOPICS

The school will cover a number of broad themes relevant to speech,
among them:


      1) Speech production and acoustic phonetics
      
      2) Articulatory, acoustic, and prosodic features
      
      3) Acoustic cues in speech perception

      4) Models of speech perception

      5) Speech  processing (Preprocessing algorithms for Speech)
      
      6) Neural Networks for automatic speech recognition
         
      7) Multi-modal speech recognition and recognition in adverse
      environments.
      
      8) Speech to speech translation (Vermobil and CSTAR projects)


      9) Applications (Foreign Language training aids, aids for
      handicapped, ....).

      10) Stochastic Models and Dialogue systems
