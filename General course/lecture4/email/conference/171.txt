First Call For Papers

EWNS2

2nd European Workshop on Neuromorphic 
Systems, 3-5 September 1999.

University of Stirling, Stirling, Scotland.

Neuromorphic systems are implementations in silicon of systems whose
architecture and design are based on neurobiological systems. This growing
area proffers exciting possibilities such as sensory systems which can
compete with human senses, pattern recognition systems that can run in
real-time and neuron models that can truly emulate living neurons.
Neuromorphic systems are at the intersection of neurophysiology, computer
science and electrical engineering.

The meeting builds on the success of EWNS1, held in Stirling in August 1997.

The meeting is intended both for the reporting of results, and for
discussion about the way forward in neuromorphic systems: What should the
role of neuromorphic systems be? Learning about neurobiological systems by
rebuilding them, or engineering new solutions to problems in sensory
perception using what we know about animal sensory perception? Can
biologically-inspired techniques provide the basis for real improvements in
auditory/visual/ olfactory/ sensorimotor systems or prostheses? How should
neuromorphic systems be implemented? Purely in hardware, or as a mixture of
software and hardware? As dedicated VLSI devices? In analogue or digital
hardware? Should particular methodologies or specific transistor
characteristics be used? Can what neuromorphic systems have to tell us about
sensory perception and coding inform cognitive science?

Papers are requested in the following areas:

	Design issues in sensorineural neuromorphic systems: 
	auditory, visual, olfactory, proprioceptory, sensorimotor systems=

	Designs for silicon implementations of neurons or neural systems.=

	Theoretical aspects of the above areas.

The meeting is being held just before ICANN'99, which will be in
Edinburgh, 7-10 September 1999.

Submission of papers:
Papers not exceeding 8 A4 pages are requested: these should be
sent to 

Dr. Leslie Smith,
Department of Computing Science,
University of Stirling,
Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland

email: lss@cs.stir.ac.uk	FAX (44) 1786 464551 	Tel (44) 1786

We also propose to hold a number of discussion sessions on some of
the questions above. Short position papers (up to 4 pages) are
also requested. 

We hope to publish the proceedings in book form after the meeting.

We are particularly keen to encourage submissions by research
students.
