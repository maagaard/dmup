Computational Neuroscience 

 Colloquium organised by Professional Group A9 (Neural networks) 

                Tuesday, 24 November 1998
                Savoy Place, London 

 PROVISIONAL PROGRAMME

 AIMS AND SCOPE 

A one-day colloquium will be encompassing developments in
this new, emerging discipline. Stemming from the activities of
Professional Group A9 on neural computing, computational
neuroscience is both an explanatory activity and a methodology
for system synthesis. It attempts to explain the findings of
neurobiologists by the application of appropriate analysis largely
derived from neural network studies and approaches synthesis
as stemming from the understanding of neurobiological
processes. Typical work in this area is the modelling of
awareness in the visual system, the role of the hippocampus in the
process of learning in humans and primates, and cortical
processing of auditory signals. At the applications end, this work
leads to studies in artificial perception in all modalities
including olfaction and taste. Invited speakers from the USA and the
UK will present their work at the meeting.
