IEE Colloquium

"Neural Networks in Multimedia Interactive Systems"

Date:  Thursday 22 October 1998
Time:  10.30 - 17.00
Place: Savoy Place, London.

The Neural Networks Professional Group (A9) of the IEE is holding an
inaugural colloquium at Savoy Place, London, on the use of neural network
models in multimedia systems.

This colloquium will present a range of current neural network
applications in the area of interactive multimedia, and will cover:
learning, intelligent agents within multimedia systems, data mining, image
processing and intelligent application interfaces.
