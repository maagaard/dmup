The experience of emotion is a ubiquitous component of the stream of
consciousness, and emotional "qualia" appear to interact with other
contents and processes of consciousness in complex ways.

Many scholars and scientists believe that no scientific or philosophic
account of consciousness can be complete without an understanding of the
role of emotion.

In an effort to advance such understanding, the International School of
Biocybernetics of the Istituto Italiano per gli Studi Filosofici, in
collaboration with Consciousness Studies of The University of Arizona,
has organized this workshop.

Abstracts of 350-500 words are being accepted that are either
reports of empirical studies or focused theoretic contributions
in any of the following topic areas.

1) Emotion and neuroscience
2) The role of emotion in conscious cognition
3) Conscious awareness of emotion and health
4) Research methods in emotion
5) Emotion and development
6) Philosophy of emotion
7) Culture and emotion

Abstracts should be clearly written and specific.

Abstracts are still being accepted.

If at all possible, please submit abstracts to center@u.arizona.edu.
