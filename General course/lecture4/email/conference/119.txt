Subject: the NEURON summer course!

X-Status: 

There have been so many re-announcements of other summer 
events through multiple channels that I was a bit hesitant 
to add to the din--but just in case you haven't heard:

Time is running out to register for the NEURON course we're 
presenting August 1-5 at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

Salient features:
1.  lots of hands-on exercises using NEURON on UNIX and 
      Windows NT workstations
2.  covers everything you need to know to get started
3.  topics include:
    --using real anatomical and biophysical data
    --extending NEURON's library of biophysical mechanisms 
        with NMODL
    --using NEURON's built-in tools for automated 
        data analysis and model optimization
    --strategies for increasing model efficiency and accuracy
    --accelerating simulations with the new variable order, 
        variable timestep integration method
    --NEURON's powerful tools for electrotonic analysis
        (as described in Carnevale et al. Comparative 
        electrotonic analysis of three classes of rat 
        hippocampal neurons. JNP 78:703-720, 1997)
        An early version of this toolkit is described at 
        http://www.neuron.yale.edu/papers/ebench/ebench.html
    --project management
    --customizing the graphical user interface
    --using NEURON to model networks of neurons

Learn all this and more from the experts!

For more information and the registration form, see
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/sdsc98/sdsc98.htm

The registration deadline is approaching rapidly, 
and only a few seats are left, so don't delay!
