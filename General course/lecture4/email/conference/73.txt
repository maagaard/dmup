Announcing an online conference for researchers and students

             The Interface of Emotion, Consciousness 
                   and Cognitive Neuroscience

                       March 2-13, 1998

The idea of this conference is that emotion can be fruitfully explored
from an interdisciplinary perspective including consciousness studies and
cognitive neuroscience.  There is an enormous frontier to be explored in
which concepts and methods of several disciplines can be used to advance
our understanding of functional neuroanatomy of emotion, and in doing so,
to potentially improve our knowledge of the basis of the pathological
emotional states, the mechanisms by which emotion stress influences
physical health, and the interactions between emotion and aspects of
cognition.

Co-sponsored by Consciousness Studies at The University of Arizona and the
Department of Psychology

Fetzer Institute.
