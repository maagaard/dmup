WELCOME TO IEEE VISUALIZATION '99

Welcome to the 10th annual IEEE Visualization conference! Please join
us in our celebration of 10 years of leading edge research in
scientific visualization by returning to the city where we started,
San Francisco, California. In the past decade the field of scientific
visualization and the IEEE visualization conference have grown in both
size and sophistication. Reflecting this growth, our keynote talk will
describe a series of workshops by the leaders in the scientific
visualization field, resulting in "Data and Visualization Corridors".
This talk will lay out some of the greatest problems facing our field
today and strategies for their solution. Our capstone speaker, Rick
Stevens, looks into the future with a presentation of "ActiveSpaces:
The Access Grid, ActiveMural and Advanced Visualization
Systems". Between these two talks you will find reports on the state
of the art in data visualization, including new research, case studies
and vociferous and opinionated panels. You will also be able to see
and try the new technologies close up in the demonstration area and
the Creative Applications Lab (CAL).

Preceding the main conference on Wednesday through Friday are the
Sunday through Tuesday sessions. In these sessions you will find
several tutorials by leaders in the field, providing you with an
opportunity for learning the background of their research, as well as
studying their new work in depth. You will also find two symposia, the
symposium on information visualization, where techniques for the
visualization of abstract information will be studied, and the
symposium on parallel visualization and graphics, where you will see
new work in the application of parallel computer systems to our field.

Our 10th conference celebration will be loudest at the Wednesday night
banquet, where we will have special entertainment as well as
recognition of those who started the visualization conference and
nurtured it to its current success.

Please join us in San Francisco, California October 24 through 29, to
make this celebration memorable at the 10th visualization conference!
