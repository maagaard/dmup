CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


1997 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics
April 27-30, 1997
Providence, RI
http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/Symp3D.htm


	Extended abstracts due:			Sept. 25, 1996
	Acceptance notification:		Nov. 11, 1996
	Final papers for Proceedings due:	Dec. 18, 1996

The focus of the symposium will be on the frontiers of real-time,
interactive 3D computer graphics and multimedia. The symposium will
consist of formal paper sessions and hands-on demonstrations where
research groups and vendors will demonstrate the state-of-the-art in the
field. Topics of interest for technical sessions and demonstrations
include:

* innovative human-machine interface paradigms for navigating, working
and playing in complex, real-time graphics environments, including
virtual worlds, Web-based systems, and visualization systems;

* high-performance 3D graphics architectures, hardware, and software for
interacting with virtual worlds and teleoperation systems;

* novel sensory I/O devices for "seeing, hearing and feeling in the
virtual world";

* perceptual and psychological issues regarding multimodal interaction
and operation in complex virtual spaces;

* interactive model building tools for shaping, building or sculpting of
objects, and the interactive assembly and manipulation of systems of
parts;

* languages or APIs for specifying geometry and behaviors for interactive
and network based applications;

* algorithms for animating complex reactive characters; authoring tools
for constructing reactive models;

* interactive simulations distributed over local and long-haul networks;

* software for representing, designing, visualizing and interacting with
complex geometry, structure and behavior.


Extended abstracts 3 to 5 pages long describing original work should
reflect the contents of the final paper and the symposium presentation.
Accompanying video tapes where appropriate are strongly recommended.
Performance claims should be supported by actual measurements. Full
explanations of any special techniques necessary to achieve real-time
picture generation and display should be provided. Abstracts should
clearly state what has been achieved and how this makes a contribution to
the state-of-the-art in interactive 3D graphics.

The program committee will review the abstracts and notify the author(s)
whether the paper will be accepted as a short or long paper, and whether
the presentation will be short or long. Short papers will be 4 pages;
long papers may be up to 12 pages.  Short presentations will be 15
minutes; long presentations will be up to 25 minutes.

Attendance will be limited to 250 participants. Places will be reserved
for up to 50 students at reduced registration rates.

CALL FOR PAPERS
IEEE Multimedia - Special Issue 
"Virtual Studios"
 
The past two years have seen the introduction of "virtual studios"
(also called "virtual sets") within the video production and
broadcast industry. Several products are now on the market and most
major broadcasters are planning trials in order to become better
acquainted with the capabilities of virtual studios.
Generally virtual studio systems operate by compositing live "blue
screen" shots with 3D imagery rendered in real time and in sync with
camera motion. Virtual studios are highly demanding applications
since rendering must occur at high rates (typically 50 or 60 Hz) and
camera tracking must be extremely accurate. Currently this requires
expensive hardware but the benefits are many: the ability to quickly
create and modify sets, reduced set construction and storage costs,
greater creative freedom in set design, and the possibility of viewing
effects live rather than during post-production.

This Special Issue will be devoted the the theme of Virtual Studios
and will concentrate on the technical aspects of their realization.
This includes (but is not limited to) the following topics:

	* head, boom and pedestal tracking
	* mechanical tracking systems
	* optical tracking systems
	* lens calibration
	* lighting
	* Z-keying and Z-mixing
	* virtual characters / virtual actors
	* set and prop dynamics
	* masking and layering techniques
	* scripting languages
	* defocussing and motion blur
	* camera distortion correction 
	* distributed virtual studios

Descriptions of experiences in virtual studio productions would also
be welcome.

Manuscripts will undergo a peer refereeing process consistent with
other archival publications. Accompanying their manuscript,
authors may also submit extra materials (such as video clips or additional
images) which will be placed on IEEE Multimedia's web site
(http://www.computer.org/pubs/multimed/multimed.htm). In this case the
manuscript should have a sidebar explaining what is on the Web.

Submissions must be in electronic form. For details please contact the
guest editor at the address below:
