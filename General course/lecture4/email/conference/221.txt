                  CALL FOR PAPERS

                            3rd EUROPEAN CONFERENCE
                      ON PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF
                   KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES
                      PRAGUE, September 15-18, 1999

ABOUT PKDD'99

Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) have emerged 
from a combination of many research areas: databases, statistics, 
machine learning, automated scientific discovery, inductive logic 
programming, artificial intelligence, visualization, decision 
science, and high performance computing. While each of these areas 
can contribute in specific ways, KDD focuses on the value that is 
added by creative combination of the contributing areas. The goal of 
PKDD '99 is to provide a European- based forum for interaction among 
all theoreticians and practitioners interested in data mining. 
Interdisciplinary collaboration is one desired outcome, but the main 
long-term focus is on theoretical principles for the emerging 
discipline of KDD and on practical applications of discovery systems 
that are built on those principles. We seek the KDD-specific 
principles that go beyond each contributing area. We seek a new 
generation of applications that go beyond applications developed in 
each contributing area.

LOCATION

PKDD'99 will take place in Prague, Czech Republic, at the campus of 
the University of Economics, 15 minutes walking distance from the 
historical center of Prague.
