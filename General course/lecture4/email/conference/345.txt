NEW!!!! NEW!!!! NEW!!!!!
SUBMISSION OF AN EXTENDED VERSION OF THE PAPER TO IEEE-TNN:
The authors of selected IJCNN'2000 papers will be invited to submit 
an extended version to the IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks 
by 30 SEPTEMBER 2000.
These submitted papers will undergo the usual Transactions review 
process. However, the Transactions Editors will receive the IJCNN'2000 
reviewing reports for each selected IJCNN'2000 paper, and thus 
the reviewing process is likely to be simpler and faster, although 
accurate as usual.
For each paper, the Associate Editor in charge may in fact ask 
the IJCNN'2000 reviewers (and/or PC members) to provide an in-depth 
review of the extended version for the IEEE-TNN. Since the reviewers 
and the PC member had already evaluated a preliminary version of the 
paper, their work is likely to be simplified.
