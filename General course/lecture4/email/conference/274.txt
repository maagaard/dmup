INTRODUCTION

The science of neural computation focusses on mathematical aspects to solve complex practical problems, and it also seeks to help neurology, brain theory and cognitive psychology in the understanding of the functioning of the nervous system by means of computational models of neurons, neural nets and subcellular processes. NC'2000 aims to become a major point of contact for research scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world in the field of Neural Computation. Participants will share the latest research, developments and ideas in the wide arena of disciplines encompassed under the heading of NC'2000 as a follow-up of the most successful NC'98 conference in Vienna, Austria.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

NC'2000 will include invited plenary talks, contributed sessions, invited sessions, workhops and tutorials.

*************************************************


INVITED SESSIONS

The organization of invited sessions is encouraged. Prospective organizers are requested to send a session proposal (consisting of 4-5 invited papers, the recommended session-chair and co-chair, as well as a short statement describing the title and the purpose of the session to the Symposium Chairman or the Symposium Organizer. Invited sessions should preferably start with a tutorial paper. The registration fee of the session organizer will be waived, if at least 4 authors of invited papers register to the conference.

*************************************************


POSTER PRESENTATIONS

Poster presentations are encouraged for people who wish to receive peer feedback and practical examples of applied research are particularly welcome. Poster sessions will allow the presentation and discussion of respective papers, which will also be included in the conference proceedings.

Proposals should be submitted as soon as possible to the Symposium Chairman or the Symposium Organizer. 

*************************************************


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are requested to either send a draft paper or an extended abstract for review by the International Program Committee. All papers must be written in English, starting with a succinct statement of the problem, the results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous work. 

Submissions must be received by October 31, 1999. Regular papers, as well as poster presentations, tutorial papers and invited sessions are encouraged.

THE FASCINATING CITY OF BERLIN

The old and new capital of Germany is a mecca for scientists and cultural enthusiasts, for day workers and night owls. Charming with its several opera houses, concert halls, cabarets, and beer gardens, Berlin is full of spontaneous cultural events or happenings. As an urban building site for the future, it is at the same time a living contradiction and a casual place with relaxation areas and large parks right in the city center. The fine nature, pine tree forests, and 1001 lakes around the city supply Berlin with its very specific sparkling air in spring time. No other city in Germany has during the last 100 years played such a prominent role in history and in the imagination of the people social and industrial revolution, world war I and later manifestation of the first German republic, the 'Golden Twenties', nazis dictatorship and world war II, splitting by the Berlin Wall, 'economic miracle' in the west and socialistic showpiece city in the east, '68 student and alternative lifestyle movement in the west and peace movement in the east, and finally, the fall of the Wall. Berlin tempts with its many research facilities, and it is Germany's largest industrial city with headquarters or dependences of most major companies. At present, approximately 3.5 million inhabitants live in the reunified city, among which more than 120.000 students, who study in three universities and twelve colleges or schools of arts. 
Berlin ist eine Reise wert. 
Welcome!
