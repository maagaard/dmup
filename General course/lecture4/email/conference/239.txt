- Graphics algorithms 
- Frameworks and application programmer interfaces 
- Load balancing, scheduling 
- Hardware and software architectures 
- Performance modeling and analysis 
- Real-time systems for 3D virtual reality
- Internet-based visualization 
- Visualizing extremely large datasets 
- High-performance computation/visualization environments

Submissions: The deadline for submissions is March 31, 1999. Final
papers will be limited to 8 proceedings pages plus one page of color
figures. Case studies are limited to four proceeding pages plus one
page of color figures. To submit a contribution, e-mail your
submission in compressed postscript format to: hwshen@nas.nasa.gov.

IEEE Symposium on information visualization (INFOVis '99)

Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Visualization and Graphics
October 25-26, 1999 - San Francisco Airport Hyatt - San Francisco, California

InfoVis '99, the fifth Information Visualization Symposium, will be
held to focus on the rapidly growing area of information
visualization. Increasing amounts of data and information and the
availability of fast digital network access are creating a rapidly
growing demand for accessing, querying and retrieving information and
data. However, information technology will not transform business,
science, medicine, engineering, and education if users cannot use it
easily and efficiently. Technology must come to the users, taking
their needs into account. If we do not involve the users, we will
develop useless systems. InfoVis '99 will focus on all aspects of
information visualization and human-centered information interfaces,
and on ways in which advances in interactive computer graphics
hardware, mass storage, and data visualization can be used to
visualize information. Submissions are solicited in all areas of
information visualization and human-centered information interfaces,
including, but not limited to, such topics as:

- Interactive information visualization
- Multi-dimensional informationvisualization
- Information presentation
- Visualization of complex information
- Information visualization for heterogeneous audiences
- Visualizing the internet and WWW
- Browsing and other Navigation methods
- Visualization Algorithms
- Visualization of Algorithms
- Visualization of textual information
- Visualization and Knowledge Discovery
- Graph / Network Visualizations
- Geographic Visualizations

Submissions: The deadline for submission is March 31, 1999. Papers
should be at most 8,000 words including an abstract, affiliation, and
keywords, and should present previously unpublished original
results. Please submit 8 copies of your paper. Video submissions (NTSC
VHS) with papers are welcome (4 copies), but are not required. Videos
will assist reviewers' assessment of the papers. Submit to:
