Workshop on Multimodal Neuroimaging:
"Accomplishments, Challenges and the Future"

We are pleased to announce the next Neuro Scan Workshop which will be held in Frankfurt, Germany on March 19 to 21, 1999 at the J.W. Goethe University Hospital.

In conjunction with the Department of Psychiatry at the J.W. Goethe University Klinikum, leading researchers from Europe, Asia, and North America will be presenting their latest work followed by open and often intensive discussions of the activities in this exciting area of research.  This format has proven very successful for both experienced and new to the field researchers.

For additional information, a listing of the speakers, registration, hotel information, etc., visit the Workshop website at http://www.neuro.com/neuroscan/workshop.htm or contact the workshop coordinator via email Loustaunau@neuro.com
