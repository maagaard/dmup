                          CALL FOR PROPOSALS

                   ICANN*99 Conference Tutorials
                          7 September 1999
                         Edinburgh, Scotland



Tutorials on current topics in the fields of research covered by
ICANN99 will be held on Tuesday 7 September 1999, the first day
of the ICANN conference program.  Proposals by qualified
individuals interested in giving a half-day tutorial are
solicited. Topics should fall within the broadly defined area of
neural networks research, including: Theory and Algorithms;
Neurobiology and Computational Neuroscience; Cognitive Modelling;
Industrial, Commercial and Medical Applications; Hardware and
Neuromorphic Engineering; Control, Robotics and Adaptive Behaviour.

It is planned to run at least 6 tutorials of around 3 hours each:
3 in parallel in the morning and another 3 in the afternoon.
Attendees will pay a registration fee and tutors will be given
some recompense for their time and effort.  Consequently we seek
very high quality proposals.

This call for proposals can be found at: 
http://www.iee.org.uk/Conf/ICANN/
and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Submission Instructions
-----------------------

Interested parties should submit via e-mail a short proposal for a
tutorial of interest by 29 March, 1999 to Dr Bruce Graham

the tutorial contents and your background and qualifications for
giving such a tutorial.  The final programme of tutorials will be
decided by the middle of April.
