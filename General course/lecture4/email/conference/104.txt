SEVENTH ANNUAL COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE MEETING (CNS*98)

July 26 - 30, 1998   Santa Barbara, California

REGISTRATION INFORMATION

************************************************************************

Registration is now open for this year's Computational Neuroscience meeting
(CNS*98).  This is the seventh in a series of annual inter-disciplinary
conferences intended to address the broad range of research approaches and
issues involved in the general field of computational neuroscience.  As in
previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and
theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists,
cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in
understanding how biological neural systems compute.  The meeting will
equally emphasize experimental,  model-based, and more abstract theoretical
approaches to understanding neurobiological computation.

The meeting in 1998 will take place at Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort in
Santa Barbara, California and include plenary, contributed, and poster
sessions.  The first session starts at 9 am, Sunday July 26th and the
meeting ends with the annual CNS banquet on Thursday evening, July 30th.
There will be no parallel sessions.  The meeting includes two half days of
informal workshops focused on current issues in computational neuroscience.
Day care will be available for children and given the beauty and
recreational interest of the area, we encourage families to attend.
