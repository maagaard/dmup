                          Call For Papers
 
                DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL
          Special Issue on Distributed Virtual Environments
 
Guest Editor: Rodger Lea

Co-published by The British Computer Society, The Institution of
Electrical Engineers and The Institute of Physics Publishing

The Distributed Systems Engineering Journal (DSEJ) is planning a special
issue on Distributed Virtual Environments for late 1998.

Distributed Virtual Environments (DVEs) are shared 3D environments that
allow multiple participants to meet, interact and manipulate the shared
scene. They have found uses in such areas as CSCW, telepresence, online
chat, data visualisation , gaming and large scale simulation. Such
environments, because of their inherent distributed nature, are forced
to solve the usual distributed system problems. However, because they
are also required to provide a degree of visual realism and sufficient
real time characteristics for group interaction, they have often
required innovative solutions to the traditional distributed system
problems. This had led to a range of distributed system architectures
from client-server, through hybrid systems up to pure, peer-to-peer
systems.

This special issue is designed to examine the state of the art in DVEs
and to expose how each system has chosen to architect the distribution
support to achieve the characteristics required for its particular
problem domain. Its goal is to provide a timely overview of the
distributed systems issues faced by DVE developers and the various
solutions adopted. As such, papers are solicited that focus on the
distributed systems architecture of DVEs and the ways that such
architectures support the target domain. Of particular interest are
papers that report on lessons learned from actual implementations,
papers discussing wide areas systems in day to day use and papers that
discuss how the nature of 3D space has been exploited in the overall
system design.
