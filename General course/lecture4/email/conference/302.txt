FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT: UI-CANCS'99 to take place in Boston on October 3-6.

should know about it before it's too late :-). Sorry about the clutter.]

What: USA-Italy Conference on Applied Neural and Cognitive Sciences
When: October 3-6, 1999
Where: Boston University Sherman Union, 775 Commonwealth Ave, Boston.

low registration rates---even including meals and a tour of local area
labs (space limited).
