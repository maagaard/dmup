Call for Papers

Invited Session "Time-critical Applications with Neural Networks"
at EUFIT '99, Aachen, Germany, September 13-16, 1999

Processing power of today's processors like PENTIUM II or PowerPC 
is sufficient for most of the applications with neural networks.
Generally, training of neural networks takes much more time than
recall of trained knowledge but for most of the (industrial) 
applications training is done only once. So there is no need
to accelerate learning process by using additional hardware.
On the other hand, some of the applications with neural networks
are run under time critical conditions where processing power of 
standard processors is not sufficient. In these cases, 
response times of a few microseconds are required. 
Typical applications are found in the sphere of trigger experiments 
in high energy physics or pattern recognition in medical 
applications.
Therfore, special purpose hardware like fast DSPs, parallel
processors or neural processor chips are used to fulfill 
timing requirements.

The invited session cares about those applications using
special purpose hardware to accelerate neural operations.
Contributions of both PC based applications using a
PC acceleration card as well as stand alone applications
e.g. using fast DSPs in combination with microcontrollers 
are welcome.
