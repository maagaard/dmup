                          CALL FOR PROPOSALS

                   ICANN*99 Post Conference Workshops
                          11 September 1999
                         Edinburgh, Scotland



Workshops on current topics in the fields of research covered by
ICANN99 will be held on Saturday 11 September 1999 immediately after
the regular ICANN conference program.  Proposals by qualified
individuals interested in chairing one of these workshops are
solicited. Topics should fall within the broadly defined area of
neural networks research, including: Theory and Algorithms;
Neurobiology and Computational Neuroscience; Cognitive Modelling;
Industrial, Commercial and Medical Applications; Hardware and
Neuromorphic Engineering; Control, Robotics and Adaptive Behaviour.

The goal of the workshops is to provide an informal forum for
researchers to discuss important issues of current interest.  The
workshops will be held on Saturday 11th September, the day following
the conference, making it convenient for ICANN participants to stay in
Edinburgh over a Saturday night and thus be eligible for cheaper
flights. It is anticipated that the registration fee for the workshops
will be nominal or perhaps zero. Please note that there is no funding
available for the workshops.

Focussed open and/or controversial issues are encouraged and preferred
as workshop topics.  Representation of alternative viewpoints and
panel-style discussions are particularly encouraged.

Workshop organizers will have responsibilities including:

1) coordinating workshop participation and content, which could
involve, for example, arranging short informal presentations by
experts working in an area, arranging for expert commentators to sit
on a discussion panel and formulating a set of discussion topics, etc.

2) moderating or leading the discussion and reporting its high points,
   findings, and conclusions to the group during evening plenary sessions

3) writing a brief summary and/or coordinating submitted material for
   post-conference electronic dissemination.


This call for proposals can be found at 
http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/daidb/people/homes/ckiw/icann/
and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Submission Instructions
-----------------------

Interested parties should submit via e-mail a short proposal for a
workshop of interest by 29 March, 1999 to Dr Chris Williams
(ckiw@dai.ed.ac.uk), Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation,
University of Edinburgh.

Proposals should include a title, a description of what the workshop
is to address and accomplish, the planned format (mini-conference,
panel discussion, or group discussion, combinations of the above,
etc), and the proposed number of speakers.  Where possible, please
also indicate potential invitees (particularly for panel discussions).
We strongly encourage that the organizers reserve a significant
portion of time for open discussion.

The proposal should motivate why the topic is of interest or
controversial, why it should be discussed and who the targeted group of
participants is.  In addition, please send a brief resume of the
prospective workshop chair, a list of publications, and evidence of
scholarship in the field of interest.  Submissions should include contact
name, address, e-mail address, phone number and fax number if available.

Proposals should be mailed electronically to ckiw@dai.ed.ac.uk.  All
proposals must be RECEIVED by March 29, 1999.  If e-mail is unavailable,
mail so as to arrive by the deadline to:
