NEURAL CODING

One of the fundamental difficulties in understanding the neural basis of
perception/cognition is understanding the computational or informational
significance of neural activity. This is true at all levels: from
individual synapses and neurons, to local circuits and large-scale
organization. The enormous complexity of the brain and the behavior it
generates demands more sophisticated development of theories of neural
coding and communication on a large scale.

In the tradition of past CVS Symposia, our goal is to bring recent
developments in this fundamentally important topic to a broader audience
than that captured by more specialized meetings. We have designed the
symposium to bring together leading scientists with diverse perspectives to
provide an opportunity for cross-fertilization and interaction that is not
usually available.

PROGRAM FOR THE MEETING

Thursday, June 1

I. Information Coding in Spike Trains
II. Early Circuits

Friday, June 2

III. Coding Experience: development and plasticity
IV. Functional specialization and distributed codes

Saturday, June 3

V. Large Scale information flow.
