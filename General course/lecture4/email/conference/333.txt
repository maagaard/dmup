FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

The recent increasing interest in the synergy between evolutionary computation
and neural networks provides an impetus for a symposium dedicated to furthering 
our understanding of this synergy and the potential utility of hybridizing 
evolutionary and neural techniques. The First IEEE Symposium on Combinations 
of Evolutionary Computation and Neural Networks will offer a forum that focuses 
specifically on the hybridization of evolutionary and neural computation. 
In particular, papers are solicited in the areas of 

+ evolutionary training of neural networks, 
+ evolutionary design of network topologies, 
+ evolution of learning (weight updating) rules, 
+ evolving solutions to inverse neural network problems, 
+ the performance of alternative variation operators in designing neural networks,
+ comparisons between evolutionary and other training methods, 
+ evolving developmental rules for neural network design, and 
+ the use of coevolution in optimizing neural networks for pattern
  recognition, gaming, or other applications. 

Other topics that combine evolutionary and neural computation are also welcome.
Submitted papers should represent unpublished, original work.
