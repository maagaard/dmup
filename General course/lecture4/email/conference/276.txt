Replacement Parts for the Brain:  Intracranial Implantation
of Hardware Models of Neural Circuitry

An NIMH, USC-AMI Sponsored Conference

August 12-14 1999, Willard Hotel Washington D.C.


 This conference will bring together leading researchers throughout
the country for a focus on one of the newest frontiers of
neuroscientific and bioengineering research: the intracranial
implantation of computer chip models of brain function as neural
prosthetics to replace damaged or dysfunctional brain tissue.  In
considering the development of "replacement parts for the brain",
speakers will address recent advances in (i) biologically realistic
mathematical models of brain or spinal cord function, (ii) silicon-
and/or photonics-based computational devices which incorporate those
models, and (ii) "neuron-silicon interface" devices, i.e.,
micron-scale multi-site electrode arrays to provide bi-directional
communication between the computational element and functioning
neuronal tissue.  The conference is intended to synergize
interdisciplinary research in the neural, engineering, and biomedical
sciences.
