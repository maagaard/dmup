                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

     The Heinz Nixdorf Institute, with support from K-Team, organizes the

                    1ST International KHEPERA Workshop
                         http://ikw99.k-team.com

              10th and 11th December 1999, Paderborn, Germany.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers from many different fields
who utilize the mini-robot Khepera as an experimental platform. The intention
is to give a comprehensive overview of the Khepera related work done so far
and to provide a forum for scientific exchange.

                            For KHEPERA USERS:

The best opportunity to exchange ideas, experience, hardware, software and
tips on Khepera. The latest research results and developments will be shown.

 ******** BRING YOUR KHEPERA ROBOTS for the big clustering demo ********
 ******** AND GET A CHANCE TO REPRODUCE ONE OF THEM !!!         ********

One of the Khepera robots participating to the demo will be selected and
his owner will win a Khepera robot kit offered by K-Team.

                          For NON KHEPERA USERS:

The best opportunity to see how to implement real robotics experiences with
the standard mobile robot, Khepera, used by more than 350 research groups.

Exchange experience and tips with the best Khepera users and developers.

This is the only conference where only papers using real robots are accepted!
