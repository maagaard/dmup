Dear Colleagues,


As a recently formed professional group we like to hear from you.
With a circle of friends we have established the non-for-profit 
"Natural and Artificial Intelligence Systems Organization"
(NAISO), presided by Professor Witold Pedrycz, University of 
Alberta, Canada. NAISO is represented by its International 
Academic Advisory Board (IAAC), professionals who stand for long
time experience and high quality. NAISO is closely cooperating 
with ICSC (International Computer Science Conventions) Canada.

The objectives of NAISO are the encouragement of efficient
communication between scientists, researchers, engineers and 
practitioners in the field of natural & artificial intelligence
systems. The promotion of interaction between research and
industry worldwide is one of our principal aims. NAISO will meet
these objectives by the arrangements of international 
conferences, symposia and workshops.

One of the first projects will be the Information Science 
Innovations Congress (ISI'2001), with four sub-symposia. 
The conference venue will be the brand new American University
of Dubai. A first short announcement follows this message.

If you are not personally interested, you may know of some
colleagues who are involved in one of the research areas and
wish to attend this friendly event. We look forward to hearing
from you. 

Thank you and best regards

The ICSC/NAISO Team

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM
ISI'2001 will include invited plenary talks, contributed 
sessions, invited sessions, workshops and tutorials. 


INVITED SESSIONS
The organization of invited sessions is encouraged. Prospective
organizers are requested to send a session proposal (consisting
of 4-5 invited papers, the recommended session-chair and 
co-chair, as well as a short statement describing the title and
the purpose of the session) to the respective symposium chair
or the congress organizer. Invited sessions should preferrably
start with a tutorial paper. The registration fee of the session
organizer will be waived, if at least 4 authors of invited
papers register to the conference.


POSTER PRESENTATIONS
Poster presentations are encouraged for people who wish to 
receive peer feedback and practical examples of applied research
are particularly welcome. Poster sessions will allow the
presentation and discussion of respective papers, which will
also be included in the conference proceedings.


WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS
Several workshops/tutorials are planned for ISI'2001. Each
workshop/tutorial will focus on a particular topic, and consist
of several presentations and open discussions. The proposal for
a workshop/tutorial should include the title, topics covered,
proposed speakers, targeted audiences, and estimated length
(hours) of the workshop/tutorial. The proposal should be
submitted either to the congress chair, the corresponding
symposium chair or the congress organizer by June 30, 2000.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS
Prospective authors are requested to either send a draft paper
(maximum 7 pages) or an extended abstract for review by the
International Program Committee. All submissions must be
written in English, starting with a succinct statement of the
problem, the results achieved, their significance and a
comparison with previous work. 

Submissions must be received by June 30, 2000.

The submission should also include
- Title of symposium (CT'2001, EBB'2001, IAM'2001 or ENAIS'2001)
