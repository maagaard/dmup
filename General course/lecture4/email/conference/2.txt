                   (PAPER DEADLINE: JUNE 1ST 1996)

Distributed Virtual Reality is a timely and attractive topic requiring
the interaction of interdisciplinary techniques. The neccessity to 
use existing technologies up to their limits is a challenge for VR 
application designers and programmers. But also from the point of analysis,
DVR systems provide an interesting testbed for performance evaluation, 
including both, modeling and measurements approaches. While solutions for 
the efficient implementation for single-user VR systems do exist - numerous
VR applications nowadays in the market prove this statement - there are 
many open problems concerning the design, implementation, and analysis of 
distributed/networked VR environment.

For this minitrack, we invite you to submit papers related to the following
research issues:

   + distributed virtual world representation
   + multimedia data processing in virtual worlds
   + networking and communication issues in DVREs
   + user interface 
   + performance evaluation
   + quality of service


Please submit eight copies of the full manuscript by June 1, 1996 to:

	Guenter Haring
	Institut Fuer Angewandte Informatik
	Universitaet Wien, Lanaugasse 2/8
	A-1080 Vienna, AUSTRIA
        Phone: + 43 1 408 63 66 12

Please, also submit a PostScript version of your paper electronically
to gabi@ani.univie.ac.at.


Manuscripts should be 22-25 typewritten, double-spaced
pages in length. Please do not send submissions that are
significantly shorter or longer than this.  Papers must
not have been previously presented or published, nor currently
submitted for journal publication.  Each manuscript will be
subjected to a rigorous refereeing process.  Manuscripts should
have a title page that includes the title of the paper, full
name(s) of author(s), affiliation(s), complete postal and electronic
mail address(es), and telephone number(s), and an abstract.
