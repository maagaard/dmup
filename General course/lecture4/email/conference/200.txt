IEE Colloquium/NCAF Meeting : Birmingham, UK, 22nd-23rd APRIL 1999

Condition Monitoring: machinery, external structures and health.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Neural computing and other computational intelligence techniques can be 
usefully employed in the areas of Condition Monitoring and Fault
Diagnosis of machines and external structures (e.g bridges), and of
Health Monitoring in medicine.  Although these areas are usually
treated quite separately, they share a number of common issues and
solutions, and should benefit from a cross-fertilisation of ideas.
The speakers at this two day colloquium will provide comprehensive
reviews of recent research and techniques employed in the domains of
condition monitoring, health monitoring, and fault diagnosis; with the
underlying aim of facilitating an exchange of ideas and solutions.

Organisers: Dr Peter Cowley (Rolls-Royce), Dr Amanda Sharkey (University of
Sheffield), Dr Keith Worden (University of Sheffield)..
