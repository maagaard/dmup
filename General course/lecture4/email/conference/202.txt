After the success of the first New Trends in Cognitive Science conference
in Vienna, Austria, we are pleased to announce its successor. While in
1997 we focused on the problem of representation (for details see 
http://www.univie.ac.at/cognition/ntcs97.htm), we will this year put 
emphasis on the notion of computationalism and its future in the 
cognitive sciences. Please have a look at the attached Call For Papers or
the conference homepage at http://www.univie.ac.at/cognition/conf/ntcs99/
for more information.

We are looking forward to welcoming you!

Purpose
-------

This international conference and workshop organized by the Austrian
Society of Cognitive Science attemps to bring together theorists working
on identifying a "successor" notion of computation--one that not only
respects the classical (and critical) limiting results about algorithms,
grammars, complexity bounds, etc., but that also does justice to
real-world concerns of daily computational practice, and thereby offers
a much better chance of serving as a possible foundation for a realistic
theory of mind.  The workshop will focus on the prospects for developing
a theory that takes computing not to be not abstract, syntactic,
disembodied, isolated, and non-intentional, but concrete, semantic,
embodied, interactive, and intentional. If such a successor notion of
computation can be defined, the resulting rehabilitated computationalism
may still be our best bet for explaining cognition.

It is hoped that this conference will set the agenda for a "philosophy
of computation" that will tackle such as issues as: the program/process
distinction; the notion of implementation and questions of physical
realization; real-time constraint and real-world interaction; the use
and limitations of models; relations between concrete and abstract; the
proper interpretation of complexity results; etc.  Addressing such
questions is a critical prerequisite for providing a firm foundation for
cognitive science in the new century.

Paper submission
----------------

Submitted manuscripts should be between 4000 and 5000 words in length
and typed doublespaced on one side of plain paper, with wide margins to
allow for editorial notes. The first page of the manuscript should only
contain the author's name and affiliation address, the article title,
and an abstract of about 100-150 words. Each page of the manuscript
should be consecutively numbered, including pages of references. 
References should be listed at the end of the article in alphabetical
and chronological order. Notes should be placed at the bottom of each
page as footnotes and numbered consecutively. Reviewing will be blind to
the identities of the authors, which requires that authors exercise some
care not to identify themselves in their papers.

3 hard copies of the manuscript should be sent to either 

     Matthias Scheutz 
     Institut fuer Wissenschaftstheorie 
     Universitaet Wien 
     Sensengasse 8/10 
     A-1090 Wien

or

     University of Notre Dame

Conference Site 
---------------

The conference will take place in the festival hall at the University of
Vienna, located in Vienna's historical first district.
