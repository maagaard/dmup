SOFSEM (SOFtware SEMinar) is the eight-day international seminar devoted
to the theory and the practice of software systems. Its program consists
of the series of invited talks given by prominent academic professionals
and researchers.  Contributed talks and posters of participants are also
included in the program of SOFSEM. The working language is English.
                   -------------------------------
Invited talks and contributed talks are published by Springer-Verlag in
the  "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" series and distributed at the
seminar.


+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Sofsem'99 is the 26th in the series of Sofsem seminars held
annually.|
 | It is intended to foster cooperation among people working in various
|
 |   areas of computer science. Its scientific program offers a unique 
|
 |       opportunity to gain a relatively quick and representative     
|
 |        overview about the selected parts of computer science,       
|
 |                    presented by top researchers.                    
|
 |   Its social program provides an optimal framework for discussions, 
|
 |  meetings, contact establishing, and socializing. Especially suited 
|
 |                 for young computer scientists.
