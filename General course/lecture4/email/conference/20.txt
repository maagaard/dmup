        Workshop on Modeling and Reasoning in Virtual Worlds
              Virtual Worlds and Simulation Conference
                   1998 Western MultiConference
                          January 11-14
                Catamaran Resort Hotel, San Diego
           http://www.scs.org/confernc/wmc98/wmc98cfp.html


Virtual worlds are one of the most compelling sites for research
in modeling and reasoning to emerge in recent years. Such worlds
(see e.g. Meadows, telnet://meadows.research.att.com:7777 and
Pueblo, http://www.pc.maricopa.edu/community/pueblo/) are
characterized by hundreds of people (e.g. K-12 students)
connecting regularly (possibly from all over the Internet)
building, playing, interacting (with each other, with "bots") in
a persistent, object-oriented, user-extensible, text-rich
context. Such worlds are often extraordinarily engaging for their
participants: for instance in the last five months on Meadows, a
handful of adults and approximately 200 children in Grades 4-9
have built over 10,000 objects (with varying levels of
sophistication and fidelity) -- homes (rooms, appliances,
toilets, swimming-pools, pets), hotels, cars, car rental
agencies, shopping malls, cities, mythical monsters, fish,
mazes...

Fundamental questions about modeling, representation and
reasoning arise in this context.  What kinds of ontologies are a
suitable basis for such extraordinarily rich and diverse
user-constructed worlds?  What kinds of theories of space, time,
action, change, causation and common-sense reasoning might one
build into such worlds?  How can such worlds be designed to
facilitate experimentation with different "frameworks for
physics"/protocols of interaction? What principles of
construction must be followed in order to allow the designs of
hundreds of such world participants to inter-operate with each
other, within a virtual world and across virtual worlds?  How can
one design in-situ reasoners that can reason with
world-constructions (and learn from past interactions) to help
human participants in designing, configuring, building,
monitoring, diagnosing/debugging systems and processes embedded
in such worlds?  How does one build intelligent
navigators/browsers that can recognize --- amidst the tens of
thousands of objects and processes --- parts of the world
"interesting" along given dimensions?  What kinds of
visual/model-based "construction environments" might one deploy
to make it easier to build such worlds? How does one design
natural language interaction systems that can leverage the
situated/contexted nature of interaction in these spaces?  How
can (collections of) software agents (bots) be designed to take
advantage of the presence of other bots, the structure of the
virtual world and interaction with people?  What frameworks for
ownership and control are needed to foster collaborative work in
such worlds, while safeguarding intellectual property?  How can
multiple modalities of interaction (text, audio, speech,
animation) be coordinated to present a coherent experience for
participants?

This meeting aims to bring together theoreticians and
practitioners from a variety of communities interested in some of
these questions --- e.g., qualitative physics and model-based
reasoning, model-based planning and diagnosis, hybrid
(continuous/discrete)and real-time reasoning, knowledge
representation, virtual worlds, constraint and visual
programming, interactive theater. 

Submissions (email plain-text to Workshop Chair) are invited on
all aspects of modeling and reasoning in virtual worlds,
including, but not limited to the broad questions raised above.
Particularly welcome are experience papers focused on practical
issues that arise in the construction of such virtual worlds, and
papers proposing theoretical frameworks within which such
questions can be addressed.
