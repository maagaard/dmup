Reframing Consciousness
Edited by Roy Ascott

Interactions between art, science and technology are leading to the 
emergence of new cultural forms, behaviours and values.
Presenting the work of over sixty highly respected theorists and 
practitioners in art and science, the book brings to questions of art 
and consciousness a stimulating diversity of approach and a rich 
background of knowledge. As a whole, the volume draws together 
papers that expose a new field of debate that is concerned with the 
active reconstruction of reality and the reinvention of the Self.

Loosely themed around four key elements of Mind, Body, Art and Values, 
the editor leads an investigation through the familiar territories of 
interactive media and artificial life, combining them with new and 
ancient ideas about creativity and authorship, the body and personal 
identity. It is shown that technology, creatively and wisely applied, 
can assist us in realising new ideas of self and society, just as the 
physical and biological sciences can provide us with new models and 
metaphors for 'being' and 'becoming'. This culture is referred to as 
the 'post biological', which is not to deny Nature its status but to 
signal the impact of the technologies of emergence and transformation 
on our understanding of consciousness and our perception of reality.
This is the first book to examine these issues in such depth, and the 
first to recognise the paradigmatic changes which art, in alliance with 
science, technology and consciousness research, is currently undergoing. 
Its appeal extends from working artists, through students and 
professionals in Art, Media and Design, to the informed general reader.

Roy Ascott is Professor and Director of CAiiA-STAR, University of Wales 
College, Newport and School of Computing, University of Plymouth. He 
has been centrally involved in developments in art, technology and 
consciousness for over forty years and has released over 100 papers, 
widely translated.
