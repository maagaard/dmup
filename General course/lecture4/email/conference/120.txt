The European Community ESPRIT Working Group in Neural and Computational
Learning Theory (NeuroCOLT) has been funded for a further three years
as the Working Group NeuroCOLT2. The overall objective of the Working
Group is to demonstrate the effectiveness of technologies that arise
from a deep understanding of the performance and implementation of
learning systems on real world data. We will continue to maintain the
Technical Report Archive of papers produced by members or associates of
the group's partners. We have created a new web site:
	http://www.neurocolt.com/ 
which gives more information about the project, including access to the
Technical Reports (see below for further access instructions).

Best wishes

***************** ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS ******************

The files and abstracts may be accessed via WWW starting from the NeuroCOLT 
homepage:

http://www.neurocolt.com/

or from the archive:
ftp://ftp.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk/pub/neurocolt/tech_reports

Alternatively, it is still possible to use ftp access as follows:

% ftp ftp.dcs.rhbnc.ac.uk  (134.219.96.1)
Name: anonymous
password: your full email address
ftp> cd pub/neurocolt/tech_reports/1998
ftp> binary
ftp> get nc-tr-1998-001.ps.Z
ftp> bye
% zcat nc-tr-1998-001.ps.Z | lpr 

Similarly for the other technical reports.


In some cases there are two files available, for example,
nc-tr-97-002-title.ps.Z
nc-tr-97-002-body.ps.Z
The first contains the title page while the second contains the body 
of the report. The single command,
ftp> mget nc-tr-97-002*
will prompt you for the files you require.
