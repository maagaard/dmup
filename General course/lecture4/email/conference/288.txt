Dear Colleagues,

Attached is the call for papers for the NLPRS'99 workshop of Natural
Language Processing and Neural Networks. Please help us to distribute
this to people who will be interested in.

			Call for Papers	

			NLPRS'99 Workshop
	Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks
		Beijing, China, November 5, 1999

                 http://korterm.kaist.ac.kr/~nlprs99/

The artificial neural networks (ANN) began to be an attract approach to
natural language processing (NLP) since several works on parsing were
done using ANN techniques in 1985. Since then, with the boom of NLP
research based on very large corpora, the ANN, as a powerful parallel
and distributed learning/processing machine, attract a more great deal
of attention from both the ANN and NLP researchers and have been
successfully used in many areas of NLP. 

This workshop will provide a forum for researchers in both the areas of
ANN and NLP who are interested in advancing the state in developing NLP
techniques by using ANN approach. 

Submissions are invited on all NLP topics in the context of using ANN
techniques.

The workshop review and acceptance will be based on a two-page extended
summary (2000 words or less). The summary must be accompanied by paper
title and author information including full names, affiliations of all
authors and the postal mailing address and email of the corresponding
author.

Submit by email to qma@crl.go.jp

IMPORTANT DATES

Summary submission deadline:    September 15
Notification of acceptance:     September 30
Camera ready papers due: 	October 15
