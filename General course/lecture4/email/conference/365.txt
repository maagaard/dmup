RIKEN Brain Science Institute will organize

            Summer Program 2000


The Brain Science Institute (BSI) at RIKEN is offering a summer program to
train advanced students interested in brain function. Applicants may choose
either a laboratory internship for two months with one of the 30
Laboratories at BSI, or participate in an intensive two-week lecture course
featuring a distinguished international faculty. Summer Interns (Plan A)
also enroll in the Lecture Course (Plan B). Travel and lodging expenses
will be supported.


Deadline : March 31, 2000
