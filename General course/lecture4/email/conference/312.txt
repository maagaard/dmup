Santa Fe Institute Complex Systems Summer School, 2000
June 4 to June 30, 2000 in Santa Fe, New Mexico USA

An intensive four-week introduction to complex behavior in mathematical,
physical and biological systems, intended for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows. No tuition is charged.

The first week will consist of an intensive series of lectures,
demonstrations, and experiments introducing some core ideas and tools of
complex systems research. The topics will include experimental and
theoretical nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation, statistical mechanics
and stochastic processes, information theory and computation theory,
adaptive computation, and computer modeling tools.  (Prior to week one,
there may be an optional intensive two-day math review.)

Weeks two and three will consist of short courses on current research in
complex systems, and students will work on individual or team projects.

Week four will be devoted to completion and presentation of student projects.

Co-Directors: Raymond E. Goldstein, Physics and Applied Mathematics,
University of Arizona; Melanie Mitchell, Biophysics, Los Alamos National
Laboratory; and Lynn Nadel, Psychology, University of Arizona.

Location: Held on the campus of the College of Santa Fe. Administered by
the Santa Fe Institute.

Application instructions: Provide a current resume with publications list
(if available), statement of current research interests, comments about why
you want to attend the school, and two letters of recommendation from
scientists who know your work.  Include your e-mail address and fax number.
