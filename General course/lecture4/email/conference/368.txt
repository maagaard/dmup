             BBS 1998 Has Expanded by 50%

                CALL FOR PAPERS

Behavioral and Brain Sciences Journal (BBS), founded in '78, has begun its
third decade in '98 with a 50% Expansion. This means that more articles
can be accorded Open Peer Commentary, the feature that has had such a
great impact on the international cognitive and biobehavioral science
community. (BBS's ISI Impact Factor of 15 is nearly three times the
highest impact Psychology journal and is one of the 25 highest among
all 6500 science, social science and Arts/Humanities journals indexed
by ISI.)

BBS is a unique scientific communication medium, providing the service
of Open Peer Commentary for reports of significant current work in
psychology, neuroscience, behavioral biology and cognitive science. If
a manuscript is judged by BBS referees and editors to be appropriate
for Commentary it is circulated to a large number of commentators
across disciplines and around the world. The target article,
commentaries, and authors' responses then co-appear in BBS.

To be eligible for publication, a paper should not only meet the
standards of a journal such as Psychological Review or the
International Review of Neurobiology in terms of conceptual rigor,
empirical grounding, and clarity of style, but should also offer a
clear rationale for soliciting Commentary.

A BBS target article can be (i) the report and discussion of empirical
research that the author judges to have broader scope and implications
than might be more appropriately reported in a specialty journal; (ii)
an unusually significant theoretical article that formally models or
systematizes a body of research; or (iii) a novel interpretation,
synthesis, or critique of existing experimental or theoretical work.
Occasionally, articles dealing with social or philosophical aspects of
the behavioral and brain sciences will be considered. Multiple reviews
of books also appear.
