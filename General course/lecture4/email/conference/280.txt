INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ON NEURAL NETS <<E.R. CAIANIELLO>>

4th Course: Subsymbolic Computation in Artificial Intelligence

ERICE-SICILY: October 24-31, 1999

=============================================================

MOTIVATIONS

Autonomous intelligent agents that perform complex real world
tasks must be able to build and process rich internal representations
that allow them to effectively draw inferences, make decisions, and,
in general, perform reasoning processes concerning their own tasks.
Within the computational framework of artificial intelligence (AI)
this problem has been faced in different ways. According to the
classical, symbolic approach, internal representations are conceived
in terms of linguistic structures, as expressions of a "language of
thought". Other traditions developed approaches that are less
linguistically oriented, and more biologically and anatomically
motivated. It is the case of neural networks, and of self-organizing
and evolutionary algorithms.

Empirical results concerning natural intelligent systems suggest that
such approaches are not fully incompatible, and that different kinds
of representation may interact. Similarly, it can be argued that the
design of artificial intelligent systems can take advantage from
different kinds of interacting representations, that are suited for
different tasks.

In this perspective, theoretical frameworks and methodological
techniques are needed, that allow to employ together in a principled
way different kinds of representation. In particular, autonomous
agents need to find the meaning for the symbols they use within
their internal processes and in the interaction with the external
world, thus overcoming the well-known symbol grounding problem.

An information processing architecture for autonomous intelligent
agents should exhibit processes that act on suitable intermediate
levels, which are intermediary among sensory data, symbolic level,
and actions. These processes could be defined in terms of
subsymbolic computation paradigms, such as neural networks, self-
organizing, and evolutionary algorithms.
