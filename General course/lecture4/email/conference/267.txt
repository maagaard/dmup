EIGHTH ANNUAL COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE MEETING (CNS*99)

July 18 - 22, 1999   Pittsburgh, Pennsylavania

REGISTRATION INFORMATION

************************************************************************

Registration is now open for this year's Computational Neuroscience meeting
(CNS*99).
 This is the eighth in a series of annual inter-disciplinary
conferences intended to address the broad range of research approaches and
issues involved in the general field of computational neuroscience.  As in
previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and
theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists,
cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in
understanding how biological neural systems compute.  The meeting will
equally emphasize experimental,  model-based, and more abstract theoretical
approaches to understanding neurobiological computation.

The meeting in 1999 will take place at Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and include plenary, contributed, and poster
sessions.  The first session starts at 9 am, Sunday July 18th and the
meeting ends with the annual CNS banquet on Thursday evening, July 22nd.
There will be no parallel sessions.  The meeting includes two half days of
informal workshops focused on current issues in computational neuroscience.
Day care will be not be available.

LOCATION:  The meeting will take place at the Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
