Aims and Scope
--------------

Following nine Eurographics workshops on Visualization in Scientific Computing
and the Eurographics - IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization in 1999, we invite
you to participate in the second 

        Joint Eurographics - IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization

Papers and case studies will form the scientific content of the the event.
Papers are invited that present research results from all areas 
of visualization. Case studies report on practical applications of 
visualization to data analysis.

Suggested topics for research papers include, but are not limited to :

- Flow visualization
- Information visualization
- Human factors in visualization
- Large data sets
- Volume rendering
- Internet-based visualization
- User interaction techniques
- Multi-Variate visualization
- Surface extraction
- Data base visualization
- Visualization systems
- Multi resolution techniques

Case studies are invited from any application area, including:
Physics, Aerospace, Automotive, Biomedicine, Chemistry,
Molecular Biology, Finance, Mathematics, Hypermedia Structures,
Data Mining.

Accepted papers and case studies will be published in a book by
Springer-Verlag. 


Important Dates
---------------

 3 December 1999 : Paper submission deadline
17 January  2000 : Notification of acceptance
18 February 2000 : Camera ready copies
29-31 May   2000 : EG-IEEE VisSym'00


Paper Submission
----------------

Authors are requested to prepare their contribution as a full paper.
Accepted papers will be published in a book by Springer-Verlag. 
Accepted research and case study papers are limited to 10 pages. In the
book one additional page of color plates per paper is available. 
Further instructions for the preparation and uploading of papers
are available via http://www.cwi.nl/vissym00

If you are not able to upload your paper electronically
you alternatively can send two copies of the full paper
including figures and images by regular mail to
