  SECOND INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON
  NEURAL MODELING OF BRAIN AND COGNITIVE DISORDERS 

  Sponsors:

     National Institute of Mental Health
     Whitaker Foundation
     National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
     National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development

     Center for Neural Basis of Cognition, CMU & Univ. of Pittsburgh 
     Adams Super Center for Brain Studies, Tel Aviv
     Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program, UMCP

  A workshop on Neural Modeling of Brain and Cognitive Disorders will be 
  held on June 4 - 6, 1998 at the University of Maryland, College Park, just 
  outside of Washington, DC.  The focus of this meeting will be on the 
  lesioning of neural network models to study disorders in neurology,
  neuropsychology and psychiatry, such as Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, aphasia,
  depression, epilepsy, neglect, parkinsonism, schizophrenia, and stroke.  
  These models attempt to explain how specific  neuroanatomical 
  and neurophysiological changes can result in various clinical manifestations, 
  and to investigate the functional organization of the symptoms that result 
  from specific brain disorders. A Proceedings consisting of abstracts from 
  the presentations will be available for attendees.

  The emphasis at the workshop will be on reviewing and discussing new 
  contributions to this field since the first meeting was held in 1995. 
  Many of the invited contributions from the first workshop appeared in a 
  World Scientific book last year; see web page indicated below.
