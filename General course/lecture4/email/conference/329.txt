           Introduction and objectives of the symposium

Some of the central problems to be solved by the brain - such as
figure-ground coding, object recognition, and the formation of object
memories - concern the binding of separately coded feature elements into
coherent object representations. The binding problem has recently been
approached by investigators in a variety of disciplines, notably
psychology (psychophysics & experimental psychology), physiology
(electrophysiology & neurophysiology) and computational modeling
(neurocomputing).

Although the wealth of empirical findings and theoretical insights
produced by these various research efforts is readily available in
specialist publications, there is little direct exchange amongst the
various disciplines involved. However, arguably, future progress towards
solving the binding problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. The
purpose of the symposium is to promote a dialogue amongst leading
experts within the various disciplines, to help identify important
shared issues and discuss ways of how these issues may be addressed
using convergent (integrated) methodologies. What follows is a brief
overview of important issues and developments within the three
disciplines psychology, neurophysiology, and computational modeling,
relating to the theme of the symposium.

The symposium will bring together about 30 leading scientists from
psychology, neurophysiology, and computational modeling in Leipzig,
Germany, in March 2000 (see list of invited participants), to help
identify important shared issues and discuss ways of how these issues
may be addressed using convergent (integrated) methodologies. Papers
presented at the symposium will focus on issues of figure-ground coding,
object recognition and memory formation, and will be organized around a
set of keynote lectures on the highlighted themes, to be given by the
following speakers:



       Gordon Baylis
       (University of South Carolina, USA):
       Psychology of figure-ground coding.

       Robert Desimone
      (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, USA):
       Neurophysiology of object coding.

       Stephen Grossberg
       (University of Boston, USA):
       Computational modeling of binding.

       Glyn W. Humphreys
       (University of Birmingham, UK):
       Neuropsychology of binding.

       James McClelland
      (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA):
       Computational modeling of the hippocampus.

       Wolf Singer
      (Max-Planck-Institut für Hirnforschung, Frankfurt, Germany):
       Neurophysiology of binding.

In addition, some 20 - 25 additoonal lectures will be given, details of
prospective speakers may be found at

http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~psyall2/symposium/participants.html

All keynote lectures and papers presented at the symposium will be
invited as contributions to a special issue of Visual Cognition (edited
by the conference organisers; acceptance for publication based peer
review) to disseminate the results of the symposium to the wider
scientific community.

            Call for participation:

Attendance of the symposium will be open to up to 50 further
participants, above all to postdoctoral researchers and advanced (Ph.D.
level) students, actively engaged in research on the above issues.
Additional participants will be encouraged to present a poster of their
research.
In this case a small charge of 75 DM (Deutschemark) (approximately
US$37), for registered Ph.D students and 150 DM (US$75) for postdoctoral
researchers, will be levied for attendance at the symposium. Selected
poster abstracts may be published in the Visual Cognition special issue.

Participants who wish to present a poster at the symposium should submit
an abstract of no more than 2000 characters or 200 -250 words to

abstracts@psychologie.uni-leipzig.de

no later than November 30th, 1999.
