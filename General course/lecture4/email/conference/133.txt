The sixth international conference Computational Finance (CF99) will
be held at NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, sponsored by the
New York University Salomon Center, the Center for Research on Information 
Systems and the Department of Statistics and Operations Research.

Computational Finance has emerged as a genuinely cross-disciplinary
research meeting. CF99 is the sixth in a series of conferences that
have been sponsored by the California Institute of Technology and the
London Business School. In the past, this conference was called Neural
Networks in the Capital Markets (NNCM). The expanding set of computational 
tools has moved this meeting from its original emphasis on neural
network techniques to a broad spectrum of different methodologies.

With several hundred attendees, this fully refereed conference has
become an international forum where original research in advanced
computational applications in finance is presented and discussed. 

CF99 brings together decision-makers and strategists from the 
financial industries, with academics from finance, statistics, 
economics, information systems and other disciplines.  In the last 
few years, the conference has seen papers covering many different
computational techniques including: statistical machine learning, Monte
Carlo simulation, data mining, knowledge discovery, bootstrapping,
genetic algorithms, nonparametric methods and information theory.

Applications in many different areas are welcome, including but not
limited to: risk management, asset allocation, dynamic trading and
hedging strategies, forecasting, numerical solutions of derivative PDEs,
option pricing and trading cost control. Studies may cover any major
international financial market including equity, foreign exchange,
bond, commodity and derivatives. The conference emphasizes in-depth
analysis and comparative evaluation with established approaches.

CF99 begins with a full day of tutorials designed to inform the 
diverse group of participants on a selection of the latest tools 
and research results. The tutorial speakers (on January 6) are: 
  o Prof. Stephen Figlewski, Stern School of Business, New York University 
  o Prof. David A. Hsieh, Fuqua School of Business, Duke University 
  o Prof. Benjamin van Roy, Stanford University
  o Prof. Halbert White, University of California, San Diego.

CF99 has two distinguished keynote speakers (on January 7 and 8):
  o H. Gifford Fong, President of Gifford Fong Associates 
  o David E. Shaw, PhD, Chairman and CEO of D. E. Shaw & Co., Inc.  

CF99 also features several invited speakers sharing their expertise
from both the academic and applied perspectives, as well as talk and
poster sessions for the accepted papers.  A selection of these papers
will appear in a book published by Kluwer in summer 1999.
