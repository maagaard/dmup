Subject: NSF/DOE Workshop on Large Scale Visualization
Status: RO

Hi:

Chris Johnson, John Reynders, and I (Kwan-Liu Ma), with the assistance 
of a small organizing committee, are moving forward with our plans to 
hold a workshop on large-scale data visualization and data management
at the DoubleTree Hotel in Salt Lake City, Utah on May 20-22, 1999.
This workshop is sponsored by both NSF and DOE. 

The format of the workshop will be talks by invited speakers, with 
some additional opportunities for shorter talks, and discussion sessions.
Attendance will be partially by invitation and partially by open 
registration on a first-come basis.  Registration begins now and
is conducted entirely online. Please visit

          http://www.icase.edu/LDV99

for more information. 

Here is the list of invited speakers:

   Chandrajit Bajaj, UT Austin
   Michael Cox, MRJ at NASA Ames Research Center
   Steve Eick, Lucent Technologies    
   Steve Hammond, NCAR
   Bernd Hamann, UC Davis
   Kai Li, Princeton University
   Bill Lorensen, GE Research
   Steve Louis, LLNL
   Dinesh Manocha, UNC, Chapel Hill
   Jamie Painter, LANL
   Will Schroeder, Kitware 
   Rick Stevens, ANL
   Philip Heermann, SNL

Contributed speakers will be selected from the attendees by a committee 
using the one-page statements submitted with the online registration.
We will update the workshop's web page periodically as planning for 
the workshop proceeds.  Key updates will also be posted to the 
vis-large emailing list (vis-large@icase.edu), and other mailing lists.

Please join us in this important activity.

  Sincerely,


  Workshop Co-Chairs

    Chris Johnson, University of Utah
