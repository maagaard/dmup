                       Biologically-inspired Machine Learning
                       --------------------------------------

                    A workshop during ACAI-99, July 1999, Greece

The BIML workshop will take place during two afternoon sessions of
ACAI-99,  which will take place between 5-16 July 1999, in Chania, 
Crete, Greece. It will consist of invited and  contributed talks,
and several panel and small-group discussions  to encourage a genuinely
interactive atmosphere. 

Technical description:
----------------------

The biologically-inspired machine learning approach is attractive 
not only as a methodology for the development and testing 
of theories of learning in biological systems, but also as an 
approach for the design of practical machine learning systems. 
The research methodology of this approach fuses techniques from several
disciplines, including Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science,
Psychology, Neuroscience, Simulation/Modelling, and Robotics.
It is the intention of this workshop to examine the interplay between
biological and artificial learning, illuminate the commonalities and
differences, and lead to a fruitful exchange of ideas and techniques.

Topics of interest include but are not restricted to:

  - modelling of cognitive, perceptual and motor development and
    adaptation in humans and animals
  - modelling of learning in infants 
  - modelling of brain and cognitive disorders and recovery
  - bio-inspired robot learning
  - artificial neural networks
  - evolutionary approaches to learning
  - learning in social environments by observation, imitation and
    cooperation.

Paper submission: 
-----------------

Papers describing research in Biologically-inspired Machine Learning are 
welcome. Submitted papers should be up to six A4 pages (two columns, 
single-spaced, body text size 10 pt), should be in Postscript format, and 
should be sent by email to both workshop organisers (contact details below). 
Papers should include full contact details (including email address) 
and affiliation of authors. 

In addition to regular papers, graduate students and other people
interested  in participating in this workshop can send a summary of
their research work  (max. two pages). All accepted full papers will be
included in the workshop  proceedings. Selected summaries will be
included if space permits. 

Registration:
-------------

All participants of the ACAI-99 main event will be able to participate in the 
workshop without extra cost. The registration fee for attending the workshop
only will be 150 ECU, to include the workshop proceedings, lunches, and 
coffee breaks (see main ACAI-99 web page for details).

Please note that since the number of participants is limited, priority will be 
given to people submitting full papers or short research summaries. 

Timetable:
----------

 * March 1,    deadline for submission of papers and research summaries.
 * March 15,   notification of acceptance/rejection.
 * April 1,    deadline for submission of final camera-ready manuscripts.
 * July  5-12, workshop in Greece. The exact times of the Workshop within this
               period will be finalised by the ACAI'99 organising committee soon.
