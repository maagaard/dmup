----------------------------------------------------

The call for papers for the ESANN 99 conference is now available on the Web:
       http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esann
For those of you who maintain WWW pages including lists of related ANN
sites: we would appreciate if you could add the above URL to your list;
thank you very much!

We try as much as possible to avoid multiple sendings of this call for
papers; however please apologize if you receive this e-mail twice, despite
our precautions.

You will find below a short version of this call for papers, without the
instructions to authors (available on the Web).  If you have difficulties
to connect to the Web please send an e-mail to
        esann@dice.ucl.ac.be
and we will send you a full version of the call for papers.

ESANN'99 is organised in collaboration with the UCL (Universite catholique
de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve) and the KULeuven (Katholiek Universiteit
Leuven), and is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Neural Networks
Council, the IEEE Region 8, the IEEE Benelux section, and the INNS
(International Neural Networks Society).


Scope and topics
----------------

The aim of the ESANN series of conference is to provide an annual European
forum for the presentation and discussion of recent advances in artificial
neural networks.  ESANN focuses on fundamental aspects of ANNs: theory,
models, learning algorithms, mathematical aspects, approximation of
functions, classification, control, time-series prediction, statistics,
signal processing, vision, self-organization, vector quantization,
evolutive learning, psychological computations, biological plausibility,
etc.  Papers on links and comparisons between ANNs and other domains of
research (such as statistics, data analysis, signal processing, biology,
psychology, evolutive learning, bio-inspired systems, etc.) are also
encouraged.

Papers will be presented orally (no parallel sessions) and in poster
sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation
during a plenary session. It is important to mention that it is the topics
of the paper which will decide if it better fits into an oral or a poster
session, not its quality. The quality of posters will be the same as the
quality of oral presentations, and both will be printed in the same way in
the proceedings. Nevertheless, authors have the choice to indicate on the
author submission form that they only accept to present their paper orally.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics which will be covered
during ESANN'99:
o theory
o models and architectures
o mathematics
o learning algorithms
o vector quantization
o self-organization
o RBF networks
o Bayesian classification
o recurrent networks
o approximation of functions
o time series forecasting
o adaptive control
o statistical data analysis
o independent component analysis
o signal processing
o natural and artificial vision
o cellular neural networks
o fuzzy neural networks
o hybrid networks
o identification of non-linear dynamic systems
o biologically plausible artificial networks
o bio-inspired systems
o formal models of biological phenomena
o neurobiological systems
o cognitive psychology
o adaptive behavior
o evolutive learning

Special sessions
----------------

Special sessions will be organised by renowned scientists in their
respective fields. Papers submitted to these sessions are reviewed
according to the same rules as any other submission. Authors who submit
papers to one of these sessions are invited to mention it on the author
submission form; nevertheless, submissions to the special sessions must
follow the same format, instructions and deadlines as any other submission,
and must be sent to the same address.

The special sessions organized during ESANN'99 are:
o      Information extraction using unsupervised neural networks
       Colin Fyfe, Univ. of Paisley (UK).
o      Spiking neurons
       Wulfram Gerstner, E.P.F. Lausanne (Switzerland).
o      Adaptive computation of structured information
       Marco Gori, Univ. di Siena (Italy)
o      Remote sensing spectral image analysis
       Erzsebet Merenyi, Univ. of Arizona (USA)
o      Large-scale recognition of sequential patterns
       Yves Moreau, K.U. Leuven (Belgium)
o      Support Vector Machines
       S. Canu, INSIA Rouen (France)
       Bernhard Schoelkopf, GMD FIRST Berlin (Germany)

Location
--------

The conference will be held in Bruges (also called "Venice of the North"),
one of the most beautiful medieval towns in Europe.  Bruges can be reached
by train from Brussels in less than one hour (frequent trains).  The town
of Bruges is world-wide known, and famous for its architectural style, its
canals, and its pleasant atmosphere.

The conference will be organised in an hotel located near the centre
(walking distance) of the town. There is no obligation for the participants
to stay in this hotel. Hotels of all level of comfort and price are
available in Bruges; there is a possibility to book a room in the hotel of
the conference, or in another one (50 m. from the first one) at a
preferential rate through the conference secretariat. A list of other
smaller hotels is also available.

The conference will be held at the Novotel hotel, Katelijnestraat 65B, 8000
Brugge, Belgium.

Call for contributions
----------------------

Prospective authors are invited to submit
- six original copies of their manuscript (including at least two originals
or very good copies without glued material, which will be used for the
proceedings)
- one signed copy of the author submission form
before December 7, 1998.  While this is not mandatory, authors are
encouraged to join a floppy disk or CD with their contribution in (generic)
PostScript or (preferred) PDF format. Sorry, electronic or fax submissions
are not accepted.

Working language of the conference (including proceedings) is English.  The
instructions to authors, together with the author submission form, are
available on the ESANN Web server:
       http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/esann
A printed version of these documents is also available through the
conference secretariat (please use email if possible).  Authors are invited
to follow the instructions to authors.  A LaTeX style file is also
available on the Web. 

Authors must indicate their choice for oral or poster presentation on the
author submission form.  They must also sign a written agreement that they
will register to the conference and present the paper in case of
acceptation of their submission.  Authors of accepted papers will have to
register before February 28, 1999.  They will benefit from the advance
registration fee.

Submissions must be sent to:
