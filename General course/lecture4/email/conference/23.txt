(This is sent to both the vrml98pc and www-vrml lists; apologies to those
who see it twice)

The VRML 98 Organizing Committee is now in place.  The current list of
members is in

       http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~broehl/vrml/vrml98comm.html 

The list is based on those who have gotten in touch with me directly in the
last few weeks.  If you would like to get involved, we'd love to have you
aboard; just drop me some email and we'll fit you it.

Thanks!
