Social agenda
In addition to being a forum for exchange of knowledge, it is hoped that the
workshop can be used to find scientific as well as social contacts. The
participants will therefore all be lodged at the same location, and there will
be various social events arranged. One of them is a fishing trip on
Saturday afternoon.


Participants
The Applicants should be PhD students from a Nordic country.

Registration
There is an upper limit of 35 participants because of the
available time for individual talks.  This requires us to
do registration through two steps, the first one being to encourage all
interested participants to send an application before 17 July 1998. The
application must contain abstracts of the presentation, a short note about your
PhD thesis and a contact address. The participants will be chosen the basis of
the submitted applications. All applications will be answered 20th July using
email as means of communication.  The participants are asked to pay a
registration fee of NOK 600,- before 24th of July. The fee covers food,
lodging and social program.
