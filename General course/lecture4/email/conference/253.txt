Workshop on Analysis of Neural Data 
________________________________________________

Modern methods and open issues in the analysis
and interpretation of time-series and imaging 
data in the neurosciences 

___________________________________________________
>> 16 August - 28 August 1999                      
>> Marine Biological Laboratories - Woods Hole, MA

A working group of scientists committed to 
quantitative approaches to problems in neuroscience
will focus their efforts on experimental and 
theoretical issues related to the analysis of large,
multi-channel data sets. 

The motivation for the work group is based on issues
that arise in two complimentary areas critical to an
understanding of brain function. The first involves 
advanced signal processing methods, particularly 
those appropriate for emerging multi-site recording 
techniques and noninvasive imaging techniques. The 
second involves the development of a calculus to 
study the dynamical behavior of nervous systems and 
the computations they perform. 

A distinguishing feature of the work group will be 
the close collaboration between experimentalists and 
theorists, particularly with regard to the analysis 
of data and the planning of experiments. The work 
group will have a small number of pedagogical 
lectures, supplemented by tutorials on relevant 
computational and mathematical techniques. 

This work group is a means to critically evaluate 
techniques for the processing of multi-channel data, 
of which imaging forms an important category. Such 
techniques are of fundamental importance for basic 
research and medical diagnostics. We have begun to
establish a repository of these techniques  
to insure the rapidly dissemination of modern 
analytical techniques throughout the neuroscience 
community. 

The work group convenes on a yearly basis.  In 1999, we
will continue to focus on topics in the analysis of 
multivariate time series data, consisting of both 
continuous and point processes. In addition, we will 
have two specialized programs on neuronal instrumentation:

* 21 August 1999 - Multisite recording of extracellular
cortical potentials with Si-based probes.  This is offered
in collaboration with the Center for Neural Communication
Technology at the University of Michigan. 
* 26 August 1999 - A comparison of analysis techniques
for fMRI data.
 
Participants: Twenty five participants, both 
experimentalists and theorists. Experimentalists are 
specifically encouraged to bring data records to the 
work group; appropriate computational facilities will 
be provided. The work group will further take 
advantage of interested investigators concurrently
present at the MBL. We encourage 
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as well 
as senior researchers to apply. 

Participant Fee: $250. 

Support: National Institutes of Health -
NIMH, NIA, NIAAA, NICHD/NCRR, NIDCD, NIDA, and NINDS. 

Organizers: David Kleinfeld (UCSD) and 
            Partha P. Mitra (Bell Laboratories).
