Dear connectionists,

there is a new paper available at
http://axon.physik.uni-bremen.de/research/papers/

    " Locking onto 3d-Structure by a Combined Vergence- and
Fusionsystem"

Abstract:  An interacting fusion- and vergence-system is presented which
utilizes two properties of coherence-based stereo: sub-pixel-precision
and a stable validation signal for disparity estimates. This allows the
system to sample the three-dimensional scene with several precisely
chosen fixation points and automatically accumulate the data into a full
disparity map. In addition, the system creates a fused cyclopean view of
the scene, co-registered with the final disparity map.

In addition, a corresponding web-page discussing this model and showing
some  samples of vergence-movies can be found at
http://axon.physik.uni-bremen.de/research/stereo/vergence/

Newly updated web-pages discussing additional models for the fusion of
stereo data into a single cyclopean view as well as the perception of
transparency & binocular rivalry can be found following the links at
http://axon.physik.uni-bremen.de/research/stereo/

Comments are very welcome.

Best regards, Rolf Henkel
