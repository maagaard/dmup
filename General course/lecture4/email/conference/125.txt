                    MIND III: Annual Conference of the 
                   Cognitive Science Society of Ireland
                         Theme: Spatial Cognition

		Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland
		           August 17-19, 1998

You are invited to participate in the Annual Conference of the CSSI, on the
Theme of Spatial Cognition, at Dublin City University from August 17-19,
1998.  This conference will bring together researchers from different
Cognitive Science disciplines (Psychology, Computer Science, Linguistics,
and Cognitive Geography) who are studying different aspects of spatial
cognition.  The conference will provide a forum for researchers to share
insights about different aspects of spatial cognition and from the
perspective of different disciplines. 

The academic programme will begin at 9:00 a.m. on August 17th and end on
19th. The social programme will include a barbecue and ceili (traditional
Irish Dance) on Tuesday 18th and a tour and concert on Wednesday after the
end of the academic programme. 

For information on registration and accommodation, please visit the web
page at:
 
                   http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/~hegarty/cssi/

The deadline for early registration is July 15th (after that the price
increases significantly).
