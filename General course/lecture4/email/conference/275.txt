INTRODUCTION

The science of neural computation focusses on mathematical aspects to solve
complex practical problems, and it also seeks to help neurology, brain theory
and cognitive psychology in the understanding of the functioning of the nervous
system by means of computational models of neurons, neural nets and subcellular
processes. NC'2000 aims to become a major point of contact for research
scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world in the field of
Neural Computation. Participants will share the latest research, developments
and ideas in the wide arena of disciplines encompassed under the heading of
NC'2000 as a follow-up of the most successful NC'98 conference in Vienna,
Austria.

SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM

NC'2000 will include invited plenary talks, contributed sessions, invited
sessions, workhops and tutorials.

*************************************************


INVITED SESSIONS

The organization of invited sessions is encouraged. Prospective organizers are
requested to send a session proposal (consisting of 4-5 invited papers, the
recommended session-chair and co-chair, as well as a short statement describing
the title and the purpose of the session to the Symposium Chairman or the
Symposium Organizer. Invited sessions should preferably start with a tutorial
paper. The registration fee of the session organizer will be waived, if at least
4 authors of invited papers register to the conference.

*************************************************


POSTER PRESENTATIONS

Poster presentations are encouraged for people who wish to receive peer feedback
and practical examples of applied research are particularly welcome. Poster
sessions will allow the presentation and discussion of respective papers, which
will also be included in the conference proceedings.

*************************************************


WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS

Proposals should be submitted as soon as possible to the Symposium Chairman or
the Symposium Organizer.

*************************************************


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Prospective authors are requested to either send a draft paper or an extended
abstract for review by the International Program Committee. All papers must be
written in English, starting with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous work.

Submissions must be received by October 31, 1999. Regular papers, as well as
poster presentations, tutorial papers and invited sessions are encouraged.

THE FASCINATING CITY OF BERLIN

The old and new capital of Germany is a mecca for scientists and cultural
enthusiasts, for day workers and night owls. Charming with its several opera
houses, concert halls, cabarets, and beer gardens, Berlin is full of spontaneous
cultural events or happenings. As an urban building site for the future, it is
at the same time a living contradiction and a casual place with relaxation areas
and large parks right in the city center. The fine nature, pine tree forests,
and '1001' lakes around the city supply Berlin with it's very specific
'sparkling air' in spring time. No other city in Germany has during the last 100
years played such a prominent role in history and in the imagination of the
people: social and industrial revolution, world war I and later manifestation of
the first German republic, the 'Golden Twenties', nazis dictatorship and world
war II, splitting by the Berlin Wall, 'economic miracle' in the west and
socialistic showpiece city in the east, '68 student and alternative lifestyle
movement in the west and peace movement in the east, and finally, the fall of
the Wall. Berlin tempts with its many research facilities, and it is Germany's
largest industrial city with headquarters or dependences of most major
vcompanies. At present, approximately 3.5 million inhabitants live in the
reunified city, among which more than 120.000 students, who study in three
universities and twelve colleges or schools of arts.
Berlin ist eine Reise wert.
Welcome!
