In September 1999  we held an EPSRC funded
EmerNet workshop, an International Workshop
on Emergent Neural Computational Architectures
Based on Neuroscience.

Topics  in the Call for Neural Networks based
on Neuroscience had included:

    1.Synchronisation: How does the brain
     synchronise its processing? How does the brain
     schedule its processing?

    2.Processing speed: How does the brain compute
     with relatively slow computing elements but still
     achieve rapid and real time performance?

    3.Robustness: How does human memory manage
     to continue to operate despite failure of its
     components?

    4.Modular construction: What can we learn from
     the brain for building modular more powerful
     artificial neural network architectures to solve
     larger tasks?

    5.Learning in context: How can we build
     learning algorithms which consider context?
     How can we design incremental learning
     algorithms and dynamic architectures?

This message is to announce that a summary as well
as all the  papers of this workshohp have been made
available at:
