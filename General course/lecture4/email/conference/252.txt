Below you can find information about a new conference of interest for
researchers in medicine, biology, statistics, AI and artificial neural
networks. (Our apologies if you receive more than one copy of this

First announcement:

                                                     ANNIMAB-1

                                       an international conference on

                      Artificial Neural Networks In Medicine And Biology

                                 Gothenburg, Sweden, May 13-16, 2000



Artificial neural network (ANN) techniques are currently being used for
many data analysis and modelling tasks in clinical medicine as well as in
theoretical biology, and the possible applications of ANNs in these fields
are countless. The ANNIMAB-1 conference will summarise the state of the
art, analyse the relations between ANN techniques and other available
methods, and point to possible future biological and medical uses of ANNs.
It will have three main themes:

1) Medical applications of artificial neural networks: for better diagnoses
and outcome predictions from clinical and laboratory data, in the analysis
of ECG and EEG signals, in medical image analysis, for the handling of
medical databases, etc.

2) Uses of ANNs in biology outside clinical medicine: for example, in
models of ecology and evolution, for data analysis in molecular biology, in
simulations of cell signalling mechanisms, and (of course) in models of
animal and human nervous systems and their capabilities.

3) Theoretical aspects: recent developments in ANN techniques, ANNs in
relation to AI and to traditional statistical procedures, possible roles of
ANNs in the medical decision process, etc. Hybrid systems and integrative
approaches, such as those involving Bayesian belief nets, will receive
special attention.

Among the keynote speakers are: Wayne Getz (Berkeley); Teuvo Kohonen
(Helsinki); Anders Lansner (Stockholm); Paulo Lisboa (Liverpool).

The size of the conference, which starts at 2PM on Saturday, May 13 and
ends at 3PM on Tuesday, May 16, will be limited to 250 participants.

The second announcement and call for papers is scheduled for August 15,
1999, and the deadline for abstract submissions is October 15, 1999.
