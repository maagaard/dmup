* APOLOGIES TO MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS OF THIS MESSAGE

A workshop titled ``Non-linear Time Series for Learning, Prediction and
Control'' will be held at the Technion, Israel, between June 29 and July 2
1998. The main thrust of the workshop will be the presentation of current
research on the rapidly evolving field of non-linear models for time
series, with applications in machine learning, prediction, filtering and
control. The workshop will consist of 30-45 minute talks by several
invited speakers from Israel and abroad (see list below), as well as
several contributed half hour talks.  The workshop will provide both
faculty and students with a unique opportunity to be introduced to the
field of non-linear time series modeling, and to discuss their research
interests with some of the leading people in the field. 

The invited speakers in the workshop come from a variety of disciplines
including: Statistics, Econometrics, Information Theory, Dynamical
Systems, Physics and Machine learning; the main intention being to achieve
a truly inter-disciplinary workshop.  All invited speakers have been asked
to provide a short introduction to their respective field. 

People interested in attending the workshop are requested to send an
e-mail message to this effect to either Dr. Ron Meir
(rmeir@dumbo.technion.ac.il) or to Dr. Hava Siegelman
(iehava@ie.technion.ac.il), as soon as possible, as the number of
participants is restricted for reasons of space.  No resgistration fee
will be required.
