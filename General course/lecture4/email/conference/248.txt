   November 9 - 11, 1999 :        ICTAI'99 Conference


SCOPE OF CONFERENCE
- -------------------

The annual ICTAI conference is an international forum for the exchange of 
ideas relating to artificial intelligence (AI) among academia, industry, 
and government agencies. It fosters the creation and transfer of such ideas, 
and promotes their cross-fertilization over all AI application domains and 
AI paradigms through a unifying theme: AI Tools. ICTAI focuses on both 
theory and developing, implementing, and evaluating theoretical and applied 
frameworks that may serve as tools for developing intelligents systems and 
pursuing AI applications. Following are some example topics of interest: 
 
    AI algorithms				
    AI in Software Engineering
    Cognitive Modeling			
    Collaborative Software Agents
    Fuzzy Logic and Reasoning Under Uncertainty
    Genetic Algorithms 			
    Intelligent tutoring/Training Systems	
    Intelligent Internet Agents
    Intelligent Interface Agents		
    Environmental Applications 
    AI in Data Mining
    Intelligent Information Retrieval
    AI in database
    Knowledge Sharing				
    Machine Learning
    Natural Language Processing and Speech Understanding
    Neural Networks				
    Planning and Scheduling
    Qualitative Reasoning 			
    Vision and Image Processing
    AI in Multimedia Systems

We are particularly interested in papers on AI tools and applications for 
Internet Technologies.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION
- ----------------------

Authors are requested to submit five copies of a double-spaced manuscript
(in English, maximum 20 pages), including an abstract and a list of subject
areas, to the program chair by May 31, 1999. In addition, an electronic copy 
(in postscript or MS Word format) of each submitted paper should be sent to 
the program chair by the submission deadline.

Each submission must report on unpublished original work and be accompanied 
by a cover letter that indicates the contact authors and appropriate subject 
areas that the paper can be classified under. Authors will be notified of 
acceptance by July 26, 1999 and will be given instructions for camera-ready 
versions of their papers at that time. 

Outstanding papers will be eligible for publication in the International 
journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools and for receiving the 
C. V. Ramamoorthy Best Paper award. 

Panel organizers are requested to submit a panel proposal consisting of a 
position statement and a list of panelists to the program chair by May 31,
