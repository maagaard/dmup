BOOM

We are bombing you with e-mail just as you are bombing with bombs which contain poison.

At least with the e-mails no one is getting killed as the bombs that you are using!

Think of how many bombs you have fired up to this date.  
How many hours of bombing daily.  
Think of how many die, think of the ecological destruction.  
Think of the illogical destruction that has occuerred! 
THINK!!!!  

!!!!!!1Do not let your mind rust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lest we forget the country that is constantly killing:  
Vietnam, Iraq, Kosovo, Havana, China.

How many murders are on the minds of your conscience?  
Blacks, Indians, Kosovars. and who knows how many more you have destroyed.

Einstein had said. 

«An inefficient large country should remain indifferent when small counties 
with a civilization,  are being destroyed by cynisism and injustice.

To kill in a war is not any less better than to kill as in a premeditated murder.
So count how many murders come back to home after the war.

Finally, you will reach the verdict to say 
that you won the war, but you did not gain peace!????.


Best wishes, for a better world.
