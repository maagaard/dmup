Disclaimer - SNN or its owners may have a position in and/or be 
paid a fee by any of the companies it mentions. SNN is NOT 
a registered investment advisor. SNN advises its readers to 
always check companies themselves or with a registered advisor 
or stock broker before buying ANY stock. Most if not all of the 
companies SNN writes about are companies at the start-up 
stage and have little or no operating history. This makes them a 
very high risk investment. Anyone who buys any of the stocks 
mentioned in the SNN letter could lose some or possibly all of 
their investment. 

Past performance of the stocks we have profiled does not reflect 
on future performance of featured stocks in SNN.
