         Have you ever wondered how the people who own mansions and drive expensive cars became so wealthy? I use to. Have you ever been at a stop light and in the car parked next to your's was a well- dressed man or woman driving a beautiful Mercedes or BMW? Did you ever wish you could just roll down your window and ask them what they did to become so wealthy? I use to.

          I would wonder if these people were smarter than me, luckier than me or maybe they were      just born into the "right" family. I use to spend countless hours brain-storming, trying to figure out what I could do to earn that kind of an income and have that kind of lifestyle. I finally figured it out. These people knew more than I did and they put their knowledge directly into a plan of action which could pay them handsomely. I was a step closer. Now all I needed was that knowledge, a plan and some guidance.  I came to understand that knowledge is a powerful tool. In most cases, if applied properly, knowledge brings success. I learned that if you want to become wealthy, you need to study wealth. And if you want to become successful, you need to study success. So that's exactly what I struck out to do. I wanted to find these wealthy & successful people and find out what they did to accumulate their fortunes and then do the exact same for myself. So what I'd like to sha!
re with you is what I discovered during my search. I also want to share with you what I have done to develop a monthly income over $35,000 while working at home. I will be introducing you to some of my colleagues who put these same concepts into practice and who are now developing successful home-based businesses of there own. Read this information and understand that if regular people like us can do this, so can you. We do not have any special skills that you do not possess. We just knew we wanted more for ourselves and our families and were determined to reach success.

           Five years ago, I was discouraged. I had worked in real-estate, advertising, as a waitress, and
even began pursuing a law degree, but nothing seemed to pan out the way I hoped it would.  What I really wanted was to run my own business, be my own boss and earn lots of money doing it.  I wanted a healthy bank account and a plush lifestyle. The problem was I didn't have the slightest inkling as to how to do that, nor did I have any special skills or insights into the marketplace. I wasn't the hardest worker around, and I had absolutely no money.  I was searching for a way to "Get Rich" when I found out about this "Work From Home" Program.  I was extremely skeptical at first. I had tried other "opportunities", only to find myself further in debt and more frustrated after the promises of success fell flat. For some reason, I decided to give this a try. I listened to the success stories and they really inspired me. I thought if average people could do this business and earn good incomes, I could too!

           I started working closely with my personal "Business Coach", who was very successful with the "Work From Home" Program. I listened to his instructions and acted on them instantly.  In essence, by doing everything he instructed me to do, I was simply duplicating his success.  I was following the blueprint for wealth, which was exactly what I wanted.  I wanted to be given guidance on what to do, as long as it wasn't difficult or compromising, and it followed a successful model.  The guidance of my personal business coach, along with a "stick to it" attitude helped me to become quite prosperous. Working from the privacy of our home, around our family, we now earn over $35,000 a month.

           For those of you who have not found your dreams and are about to give up on them totally, I
encourage you to read on and learn how regular people like you and me are earning extraordinary incomes with the "Work From Home" Internet Program. If you choose not to read on, we bid you farewell and wish you good luck in your journey. However, if you're still not living the life you dream of, exactly when will you find the time to design a plan that will provide a wonderful lifestyle for you and your family? When will you stop making a living long enough to start creating a lifestyle you truly love? If not now, when?



                                  In America, there is never a lack of opportunity,
               simply a shortage of people daring enough to pursue greatness to the end.



           We are here to share with you the results we've achieved. It is then up to you to choose
whether or not this is for you. Obviously, based on my success, you already know you do not need to possess any sort of business background to make this business work. However, if you are well-versed in management, administration or marketing, you will be even further ahead.

         Maybe some of you have tried other businesses and failed. We welcome you with open
arms. Here you will find success because we give you the blueprint to follow and support you need to develop your own profitable home-based business. All we ask of you is to be coachable and be willing to learn. We have no need for tire-kickers or window shoppers.  Please do not request our "decision package" if you are not serious about changing the course in your life right now. By ordering your "decision package", you will receive all you need to get yourself moving towards financial independence.

           So, if you are tired of worrying about money and tired of choosing what you can live without,
come join the thousands of us working from home, setting our own schedules, making a fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore how the "Work From Home" Internet Program capitalizes on today's advancements in technology to help you build a successful home-based business.    

Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based businesses?  Did you know that 32 million households now have home-based businesses and that number grows every day? Have you asked yourself, "Why?" Why are so many people, including yourself, interested in working from home? Our parents never searched for a business to operate from home nor did their friends. So, why now and why is it suddenly so popular?

            Americans are "cocooning". We want to spend less time on the busy freeways commuting, and in over-crowded shopping malls and replace that with spending more time at home with our families where it is warm and safe. Apparently, we trust society less and want to protect ourselves and our families from the "cruel" outside world. This is the wave of the future and we are beginning to realize with the advancement in technology, we do not need to be in an office environment in order to access the marketplace and make money. 

            In today's world, the quickest way to build a home-based business is to take advantage of the Internet craze that has hit the United States and is quickly spreading around the world. Like how the Gutenberg Press radically changed the communication world in 16th Century Europe, the Internet is revolutionizing how we communicate, distribute information and the manner in how and where we spend our money. It has been said that those who pursue electronic commerce (business over the Internet) have the opportunity to build an explosive business.

            While a conventional business can cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up and run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically less and has the potential to attract international business for just a fraction of what the traditional company would spend. On average,
         
          30% of all U.S. web traffic is already international and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate from outside the United States. Everyday, these percentages are radically  increasing. Consumers world-wide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year in transactions over the Internet.

            The awareness level and need for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to get onto the Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one year ago.  This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we are reaping the benefits, daily.

            If you combine the Internet craze with people's desire to work from home and set their own schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many people have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of New York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to "Small Office/Home Office." One of today's biggest explosions in the economy. The home-based business has been born out of necessity. In an era where large corporations can only think of downsizing, what are your options? There is no security in Corporate America any more!  Not only are tens of thousands of workers and managers being downsized out of their companies, but thousands of men and women are tired of the corporate "rat race" and want to retreat to a home-based business.

            If you decide to "stick it out" in Corporate America, your choices could boil down to
         finding a lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line at the
         unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits. We were all raised to
         give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we are not backing away from that. Today's
         large companies have no loyalty to the employees. Their only loyalty is to the
         bottom line. And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when it's time to cut
         back. Your life is suddenly turned upside down because you have no control over your
         future. These decisions are made behind closed doors by someone who has no idea
         of the quality of your work or the extra time you gave the company without requesting
         overtime. They don't know about your family's life: they don't understand that
         you just put braces on your child's teeth and now have to pay for them. These
         "decision makers" job is to be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the
         company's "best interests." In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY DON'T
         MATTER.

            The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. government reports indicate
         that more than 3.5 million jobs have been eliminated in the past 10 years - including
         over 2000 jobs per day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all jobs created in
         the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores, restaurants, and bars. 90% of
         all the people in North America earn less than $40,000 a year and today's two
         income families are not living as well as their parents did.

            So what is the alternative to the to the Great American Job? Richard Poe, former
         senior editor for "Success Magazine," describes in his recent book that a shift in
         thinking has resulted in over 14 million people working from home full-time, and
         another 13 million part-time. This number is increasing by almost 600,000 per year.
         And the average work from home income is $50,250 per year, about twice the
         average income of wage earners working for someone else. By the end of the
         decade over 44% of us will be working from home.

            Home based business wage earner's success rate is over 85% compared
         with small businesses like retail shops and restaurants, at about 95% failure rate after
         5 years. Couple that with the flexibility we have to change our schedules and set
         our hours and then those of us who are parents are now available when our
         children need us, plus we no longer have the need for the "foster homes" we call
         day cares, where the care-givers get to see all the "firsts" your child performs. There's
         no wonder the number of people looking to work from home has skyrocketed.

            This "New Era" of financial growth is largely due to the latest technologies that are
         now available to those who desire to work from home. Imagine what it would be like
         to run an international operation if you so choose, right from the comfort of your own
         home. Well, this is exactly what we offer! We offer a "freedom" that is available
         through a constant flow of income that does not depend on the whims of a
         boss, bonuses or the economy.

            Take a look at some of these statistics:

                  At age 50: 

                   75% of the population has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement. 

                  At age 65:

                   45% of Americans depend on relatives 
                   30% depend on charities. 
                   23% are still working (most can't afford to quit and work until they are no
                   longer physically capable). 
                   Only 2% are self sustaining. 

                  At the present time: 

                   It is impossible to support a family of two working full time at minimum
                   wage! 
                   For the first time in history, the current generation is averaging a lower
                   standard of living then their parents! 
                   Automation is taking layoffs to record highs! 

                  The Bureau of Labor Statistics says... ... 

                   Out of 100 people that start working at the age of 25, by the age of 65... -
                   1 is wealthy - 4 have enough money to retire - 63 depend on social
                   security or charity - 29 are deceased 
                   95% of people, age 65 and over can not afford to retire and work until
                   they die!!
                   
                                        What Happened to Safety & Security? 
                           Why we no longer put our trust & faith in "Big Business"



              In J. Paul Getty's book "How To Get Rich", his first rule for success is, "You must
           be in business for yourself. You will never get rich working for someone
           else." This partly explains why someone starts a new home-based business in the
           United States every 10 seconds. In the past 14 years alone, the number of
           home-based businesses have grown from 6 million to 32 million with no slow - down
           in sight. In fact, an estimated 8,493 new home businesses open every day.

              The United States is now driven by an information and service economy. Over the
           past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid off 4.4 million workers while
           smaller companies steadily continue to reduce their work forces.

              As companies continue to downsize and re-organize, many professionals will
           seek out and search for new ways to take control of their careers. Many of these
           individuals have forsworn traditional "nine to five" office jobs and are making their
           homes pay off in more ways than one.

              For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses have become the bridge between
           work- crazed big cities and easy- paced, family-oriented small towns. Link Resources
           Corp. reports that market research shows more than 29 million people run either
           full-time or part-time businesses from their homes. People used to believe that
           their livelihood depended on living in big cities near big corporations. That is no
           longer true, thanks to personal computers, increased phone services, fax
           machines, and the Internet, it is no longer necessary to live in close proximity to
           "Big Business". You can now operate that "Big Business" right from your
           home office.

              Within the last five to seven years, technology has been brought to an affordable
           level so that almost everyone has an equal playing field in the work-from-home
           industry.

           Check out these Statistics:

                11% of the US market is now on the Internet 
                250,000 new people get Internet access each week. 
                While approximately 27% of the US adult population, or 53 million US citizen's
                currently use the Internet, according to the Fall 1998 Cyber Stats reports from
                Mediamark Research Inc. This is an increase of 23% from the prior quarter,
                and this study only counts people who have used the Internet in the last 30 days.
                Ziff-Davis's Technology User Profile reported that there are 60 million PC's
                connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's still represent the lion's
                share of the market, with 28 million consumers hooked up to the Internet. 
                They predict that up to $32 billion US dollars will change hands from business
                transactions online by year 2000. 

              Most people are ready to do some sort of business online, they just don't know
           where to start. This is why we are so successful. We link-up our marketing techniques
           with something people need, and most of all, something people want. If you add
           strong work ethics, a powerful support system, along with personal business
           coaching, you can't help but be successful. We provide not only the vehicle that
           puts you on the road to success, but we also provide the road map.

All you have to do is be teachable, have the desire for a better life and be willing to change
what you're doing now.

                86% of home-based business owners are happier running their own
                business versus working for someone else. 
                84% recommend working from home to others. 
                84% plan to still be running their own business in five years. 
                20% of home entrepreneurs reported that their businesses grossed between
                $100,000 and $500,000 last year. 
                14% paid themselves annual salaries of $50,000 to $250,000. 
                29% work at home with other family members. 
                60% think their businesses are doing as well or better than they
                expected. 
                76% expect their home-based business revenues to grow this year. 

              Your search for the ideal work environment and for the ideal vehicle to wealth is
           over. You will be able to work more flexible hours while increasing your
           productivity, not to mention drastically cutting your commute time, and increasing
           your most precious commodity-quality of life. 

              We have developed one of the most exciting, technologically advanced
           home-based businesses that will take you through the new millennium. 

              We don't expect you to come to us with tremendous business knowledge or a
           successful track record. We have already figured out how to make this work; all
           you need to do is copy what we're already doing. 

           

                                                What is a Business Coach?
                         Will I really have help building my home-based business?



            Why a business coach? Well, if you watch professional sports, you'll notice that not
         only does every team have a coach, but every player has one as well. In order for each
         player to reach their maximum potential, they need a person who is an
         impartial observer and who's main focus is helping that individual realize their
         full potential. A coach does not "fix" or motivate. A coach educates. Coaches can
         only work with someone who is already up to great things, but still wants
         more. 

           In the business world, all successful business people surround themselves
         with coaches. Frequently, they are referred to as consultants, investment advisors,
         public relations specialists and statisticians. The reason most of these individuals
         are so successful is because the coaches are behind them helping them
         breakthrough barriers that normally would have stopped them. 

                            If someone is going down the wrong road, 
                           he doesn't need motivation to speed him up. 
                         What he needs is education to turn him around.


            Your business coach is a real person who will work with you as often as
         you want. If that translates into three times a day or every other week, they will be
         there for you. Your coach's commitment is to teach you how to build a
         successful home-based business. Your coach's commitment will be determined by
         your teachability and your actions. However, ultimately, you create your own success. 

            Remember, your success is our success. Our commitment is for you to have a
         successful business. That's where our success lies - in our commitment to helping
         others get what they want! 

         

                                    Are You Ready for a Better Lifestyle? 
                              Accept the challenge to make a change, today!



              We accepted the challenge to make a change in our lives. We made the decision
           to improve our lifestyle, our self-esteem, and to finally secure our future. I can assure
           you, at the time, the decision was not easy to make, but looking back at it, it was well
           worth it! And it can be the same for you, too!

              In order to accept any challenge, you must first gather enough facts to make an
           informed decision. We have put together a system that helps us to filter out the "tire
           kickers" and the curiosity seekers. For those of you who continue on to the next step,
           you are the few who are ready to make a change in your present circumstances. It is
           you we want to spend our time with. We want to put the majority of our energy into the
           people who are ready to accept a better lifestyle for themselves and for their families.
           Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless questions of the
           curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it frees us up in order to dedicate ourselves
           to your success. When we spend time with you, we know we are working with
           someone who, like us, is committed to a better lifestyle. 

              Once you have reviewed your "Decision Package", we will conduct an interview
           with you either in person or over the phone. From there, your training will begin right in
           the comfort of your own home. You will have a personal coach who will guide you
           through every step of the way. They will also be available to answer any questions you
           have. You will also be in communication with the other people you read about here on
           our site. They are available to help train you and work with you just as they did with us.

              The question is not whether or not our system works. Hopefully, we have already
           proven to you that our system is successful. The question is whether or not you are
           ready to truly improve the quality of your life. Obviously, if you have already made the
           decision to improve your future, you are ready to learn the new skills necessary to
           take charge of your life. It is people like you, that we are looking to work with. 

                   Buckle Up - It's Time to Make a Change...
                  and We are Here to Help You do Just That!

              You may be surprised to find this out, but most people do not want to make the
           necessary changes in their life in order to have and achieve what they've always
           dreamed of. A lot of people are content to sit on the couch in front of the television
           and watch their dreams disappear in front of their eyes. They will sit and hope
           someone will come along who will make it all better. What if that someone never
           shows up? Do you want to put your future in the hands of a stranger or do you want to
           be the master of your own destiny? 

              Most people who succeed in life are self-motivated and driven. Unfortunately,
           these two character traits aren't always enough to get you what you want. You also
           have to possess the desire to change and grow as an individual. If you were to take
           an idiot and motivate him, all you would have is a "motivated idiot". Motivation alone
           is apparently not the answer. So what is? It is necessary to couple motivation with
           direction and guidance. This is the exact combination we offer you. 

              We will show you the way. We will walk down that path with you and we'll be there
           to see you reach the top. Remember, your success is our success. We have nothing
           to gain by you falling short. 

                            What is Your Future Worth?

              Decide for yourself and for your family what it is you want and by when you want to
           achieve it. Only you can determine how dedicated you are to achieving your dreams.
           Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and family for direction and
           salvation. They can not provide that for you - only you can do that. You need to make a
           decision to either give this a shot or to continue down the path you're on. Most likely, if
           you have read this far, you have already made the decision to make some healthy
           changes in your life. When we were looking at this "Work From Home" Opportunity for
           the first time, just like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this wouldn't
           work. Like you, we doubted we could really achieve our dreams. We went for it any
           way and now we are making incredible incomes, working from home, and for most of
           us- it's a dream come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a clock to punch.
           Remember though, we didn't start off full-time. For most of us we did this part-time
           until our part-time incomes surpassed our full-time incomes. We don't recommend
           you quit your present job until you have at least doubled your present income. 

              Another item that might be hanging in the back of your mind is the fear that you will
           have to invest thousands of dollars. So let me put that to rest right now. You don't
           need to dig up thousands of dollars to get started with us. Right now, all you need to
           do is get your "Decision Package" so you can get started today. 

                             Why give up your dreams?

              We know you are the kind of person we are looking to work with, because you
           have given up this much of your time to read about us. You have already displayed
           exactly what one needs in order to be successful in our business- that high degree of
           curiosity coupled with an intense desire to succeed. 

              All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering your "Decision
           Package" and we'll be there to help you through your questions and then to work with
           you to build your own "Work From Home" Internet Business. But please don't request
           more information unless you are committed to improving your life. If you are ready to
           learn and you are serious about achieving a brighter future and a better life, then we
           are committed to you. We are ready to give you the same step-by-step plan we used
           to build our fortune. There will be no surprises. We know exactly what to do and how
           to coach others be successful within the same system. Our Program works. It's
           already happening for hundreds of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next
           step, and get started on your way to a brighter lifestyle. 

                                  We Look Forward to Having You join our Team!

                                       Order your "Decision Package" Today,
                                        using the "Take Action" Button below.

                                                    Your Next Step
                                            Where do I go From Here?

            Since you've gotten this far, we know you are serious about working from
         home. Your next step will help you make some changes and learn some new
         skills. So, let's go!

            As you know , this is not a lay-on-the-couch, get-rich-quick scheme. This is
         a REAL business and a real opportunity- one that has drawn so much interest from
         people that we had to put this screening process in place to help us determine who to
         work with. Our company has been in business for 19 years, is publicly held and
         traded on the NASDAQ. It is important that you realize that we can help you
         build a powerful and profitable business.

            We have an explosive, start to finish, proven Internet Marketing system.
         And we are offering you this simple easy method where you can make money
         working for yourself, over the Internet, from the comfort of your home or office. You can
         earn $1,000 to $7,000 per month working around your current job and your family's
         schedule. Our system works regardless of your background or computer
         knowledge. We provide the system, experience and hands on training. The
         only thing that we can not give you, but is required, is that you have the desire, and
         that you are teachable. We know that you have some level of desire because you got
         this far. Are you teachable?

            If you are, we have put together a "How to do business over the Internet"
         decision package that will help you determine whether our business is for you or not.
         This step is only for individuals who have the desire to control their own
         future and who want to work from their homes and earn the kind of income
         that will give you the life you deserve. This decision package contains
         approximately three hours of information about our explosive Internet business and it
         also begins your training. You will receive a manual that explains how, why and what
         we are doing, a video where you'll meet us and see exactly how our business works
         and an audio tape to further help you with your decision. Your package also contains
         the name and telephone number of your personal coach who will be working with you
         on a daily basis, helping you make money in your first week. In other words, you
         will receive all of the information you will need to make a decision to determine if this
         is for you. Obviously, because the "decision package" materials, packaging, shipping
         and handling costs us, there is a REFUNDABLE $39 price for the entire package.
         The $39 is fully refundable if you decide this is not for you. This package is not how
         we make money with our Internet business. The package acts only as a way for
         you to review information about our business and begins your training without risk.

            This step eliminates the people who are not serious and allows us to work with
         those of you who are. Please recognize the importance of this step. We simply do
         not have the time to spend with people who are merely curious, which is why
         we designed this package to provide you with all of the information you will
         need to make a decision and determine if this is for you. If we spent our time
         answering e-mail requests for additional information, we'd not only be duplicating the
         effort we put into developing the decision package, but we'd also be taking valuable
         time away from running our business and training new people. Once you start working
         with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time training you instead of
         responding to curious e-mails all day long.

            At the end of this page there is a "Take Action" Button which will take you to the
         order form which you can send to us via e-mail or fax. Be sure to fill out all fields,
         especially your daytime and evening telephone number with area code so we can
         confirm your order and method of payment. All orders will be shipped within 48
         hours of confirmation. Due to the overwhelming interest in our unique system,
         please assist us by indicating the exact time you can be reached today so
         that neither of us wastes time playing phone tag and you have the
         opportunity to take an in-depth look at our system. All orders will be sent via
         Priority Mail. If you prefer to pay with a credit card , please leave your credit number
         with expiration date on the order form. You can pay by Master Card, Visa, Discover,
         AMEX, or Personal Check.

            We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have done with us,
         to help secure your financial future. But, remember, we only work with those
         that truly have the desire and ambition to work-we don't have time to work
         with couch potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't.
         So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value! Procrastination is the
         biggest killer of success and you can now break that cycle! REMEMBER, for things
         to change, you have to change and for things to get better, you have to get
         better. Order your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything
         thoroughly BEFORE calling your personal coach.

            Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking for people
         who are teachable and willing to work. We're very excited about our future and we
         know you will be, too!! Until we speak personally, thank you and have a great day!

         choose to order a "Decision Package", then kindly visit our "Guestbook" and we will
         keep you apprized of new developments in our "Work From Home" Internet Program.

         to process orders and we will be unable to reply to mere inquiries.

           We have a $39.95 decision package (book, audio tape, and videocassette) that explains the
         "Work From Home" Internet Program to you. Inside your decision package you will receive
         the name and phone number of your personal coach. They will be taking you under their
         wing to help assure your success. Don't forget "Your success is our success". Can you be
         successful working from home? Yes - anyone can, regardless of your background or
         computer knowledge. You don't need any special skills or a strong personality. All you need
         is the courage to get started. You can do this business, as long as you are teachable and
         have the desire to succeed.
