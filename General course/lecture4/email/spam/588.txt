Dear nytimes.com subscriber,

Announcing a special offer from JandR.com!

**SPECIAL SALE!** AIWA XR-MD95 - Ultra Mini Audio System***

Suggested Retail Price $850.00 NOW ONLY $249.99!

At first glance, the Aiwa XR-MD95 Micro Component package is an
extraordinarily compact and sleekly designed stereo system. At about 8
inches high, it is able to fit virtually anywhere. Like any work of art,
however, there are many nuances that set this apart from almost any other
stereo system of its size. These subtleties are well worth a careful
examination.
ORDER NOW!

Here are just some of the details:

Two miniature components (4 inches high each) include a digital AM/FM radio,
a CD player and a digital MiniDisc recorder and player. An integrated,
backlit, easy-to-read LCD screen displays many unique functions. Two 2-Way,
Bass-Reflex speaker systems have a glossy, lacquered, deep-woodgrain finish
and a distinctive cloth-grille face.

A high-powered, dedicated amplifier delivers 16 watts per channel for a
total stereo power output of 32 watts. With an incredibly high-fidelity
frequency range of 50Hz to 20,000Hz, music emerges with sonorously smooth
clarity and character that clearly belies the compactness of the
instrument.

An AM/FM Digitally Synthesized Tuner allows custom programmability of up to
32 favorite radio stations for conveniently quick access. You're also able
to scroll through the bands to find any other stations that may pique your
interests. It even has a timer function for lulling you to sleep or for
daily awakening.

A top loading, CD player has up to 30-track user programmability. You may
also choose among several random and repeat play modes. There's a 16-track
music calendar to display the tracks on your CD.

The front-loading MiniDisc recorder and player is, perhaps, the most
outstanding feature of this already elite performer. Using compact and
relatively inexpensive MiniDiscs, you can record true digital recordings
from the radio or from a CD. That's sound that is as pure as the original!

An Electronic Graphic Equalizer allows selection of the optimal setting for
Rock, Pop or Jazz recordings. Aiwa's exclusive Super T-Bass may be selected
for adding dimension to overall sound performance. Three-position selectable

BBE system helps put you in the best listening position for the utmost in
sound integrity. An output is provided to add an optional powered subwoofer
for rich low frequencies.

Fully digital controls are hidden from view in a front drawer with
convenient motorized operation. A handy, full-function, remote control is
also provided.

The Aiwa XR-MD95 is like a jewel. The more you look and listen, the greater
your appreciation. With J&R's special pricing, this stereo system is an
exciting steal!
