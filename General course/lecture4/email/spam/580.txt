        Are you tired of paying for web hosting service that's too
expensive and is down 99.9% of the time?  Well, so were we.
GetWebHosting.com is a company that was established by unsatisfied
customers.  We shopped around from web hosting companies at the very
bottom to the very top.  We found that the more money we would pay for
services, the less we actually received.  Soon after GetWebHosting.com
was established.  The company founders offer there services to people
who are also tired of companies who promise the world and wind up giving
nothing. We offer the small business and average person web hosting
services that are affordable as well as reliable.
    Our three main plans offer the same services as all other companies
do; however, our plans range from a low cost of $4.99 per month to
$14.99 per month.


   * We have no contracts, you may cancel your account if you are not
     satisfied with our services with a full money back guarantee.
   * You do not have to prepay for the year.  We encourage our customers
     to pay monthly.
   * As a special offer, we have no initial setup fees.
   * Our service is guaranteed to be up 99.9% of the time.
   * Every customer will be treated with the same respect we, the
     founders of GetWebHosting.com, were looking for in other web
     hosting companies.

    If any of the above information sounds all to familiar, please allow
GetWebHosting.com to show you how clients are supposed to be treated.
