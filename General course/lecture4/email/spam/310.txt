SNN #15

NEW PROFILE RELEASED TODAY ON:

Wcollect.com

Symbol: WCLT
ENCLOSED IS YOUR FREE COPY OF SNN #15-AN INTERNET
NEWSLETTER ON EMERGING SMALL CAP STOCKS. IF YOU
WISH TO UNSUBSCRIBE PLEASE SEE BELOW. THANK YOU.


This edition of StockNetworking News will be devoted to a new
profile on Wcollect.com, a new and exciting entry in the expanding
world of on-line commerce.

We are also including a News Release on Access1 (AONE) that came
out Friday 12th.

While eBay and uBid have had tremendous success on-line, and
in the stock market to date, we feel that their approach of selling
everything from "soup to nuts" will be attacked by a variety of
"specialty" sites such as Wcollect.com

Please review Wcollect.com's Executive Summary by going to:

http://www.brandcom.net/wcollect/

Then visit their brand new web site at:

http://www.Wcollect.com

We feel you will be impressed by the "star" power
of the site.

The company will start to trade on Tuesday, February 16, 1999,
under the symbol: WCLT on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board.
There are 8.43 million shares issued and outstanding of
which 4.0 million are free trading.

Once again, the market will determine the price at which the
stock will trade but it is expected there could be strong
interest starting in the $4.00-$4.50 range. Also watch for
outside media coverage on this company. Given their
involvement with the Arts and celebrities this is a perfect
story for TV shows such as Entertainment Tonight.

If you want to contact the company directly they will have
someone in to answer the phones all weekend and can be
contacted on their toll free lines at:  1-877-608-1611
