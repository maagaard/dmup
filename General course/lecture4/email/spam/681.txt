Subject: Shrink the Debug Cycle with AMCs LiveCODE!
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Analyze Trace Interactively
Fix Code On-The-Fly
Check out LiveCODE, Win a DVD Player!

As many software developers know, debugging an application while
trying to meet critical time-to-market and quality pressures can
be a tedious undertaking. Finding those intermittent bugs that only
occur at run-time is nearly impossible. Applied Microsystems 
introduces LiveCODE, a new software debug tool that enables 
developers to trace execution history, as well as insert statements 
into the executable, all while the applications RUNS IN-TARGET!
LiveCODE dramatically increases developer productivity by liminating 
time consuming breakpoint-single steps and "printf" 
compile/link/load cycles during the traditional debug process.
