                A College Business Degree in Months???
 

    That's right!  You could "EARN" a Bachelors, Masters or 
Doctorate degree from a well known, prestigious university in 
MONTHS instead of years and it is completely legitimate!! 

                            How?

   By enrolling in one of the many non-traditional degree 
programs offered by many of the countries top accredited
schools. Schools such as American University, Brigham Young, 
Colorado State University, Dartmouth, Drake, George Washington 
and 100's of others are all currently offering non-traditional 
degree programs in almost every field of study ( business, 
accounting, medical, law etc..)and they can, in some cases, be 
earned in months instead of years and many through correspondence 
or internet studies. You will never have to leave your home and 
here's the best part-- No one will ever know how you earned it 
unless "you" tell them.

***Competition with Technical Trade schools have forced the main 
stream universities to offer alternative degree programs and now 
"you" can benefit from it!! 
     
     I have compiled a packet that lists over 700 accredited and 
non-accredited universities that offer such programs and for the 
small fee of $29.95 I will send it to you. 

Here's what you will get: A 270 Page document containing-

1) A comprehensive list of over 700 US and foreign schools (over 
500 are state or otherwise accredited) that offer traditional & 
non-traditional degree programs from a Bachelors to a Doctorate 
in almost every field of study.

2) Information on each school listed that will include Degrees 
offered, How to apply, Who to contact and What are the fees and 
loan/grant information.

3) A list of over 50 state agencies that govern university 
education programs. Therefore you can investigate concerns of 
legitimacy yourself for each individual school.

4) Finally, just for fun, I will include a list of over 200 
universities, commonly known as "diploma mills" which will sell 
you any degree or diploma you wish. Prices range from $5-$100. 
                                      
                  "Is there a Doctor in the house?"
     
                Simply send $29.95 in US funds only
                (check or money order) to:
