         What’s new at TechOnLine for December, 1999

           Two new Networks: EDANET and ANALOGNET
       New courses and lectures at TechOnLine University
       Feature Articles on Embedded Internet technology
    Feature Articles and Viewpoints by EDA industry experts
                 http://www.techonline.com

Because an engineering portal on the Internet is valuable only if the 
people overseeing it are steeped in their technologies and their 
industries, TechOnLine recently added some stellar editorial/engineering 
talent to its roster: Rich Quinnell, Rita Glover, Jeff Michalski and Jim 
Lipman. Rich Quinnell is in charge of EMBEDDEDNET, Rita Glover is 
overseeing EDANET (with Jim Lipman’s help until we launch SOCNET in 
February) and Jeff Michalski will be running APPLIANCENET when it’s 
debuted in mid-January.

These key industry stalwarts will expand the content and services 
available to you at TechOnLine and work with the rest of the TechOnLine 
team to integrate a variety of valuable technical information and 
resources into a structure and organization that’s consistent and 
easy-to-access. Take a look at this month’s TechOnLine Review to read 
more about all of them.

APPLIANCENET:  TechOnLine Stays Ahead of the Curve

What’s one of the hottest, most talked about segment of the electronics 
and computer industry today? There’s some really hot action taking place 
in a new industry segment called “Internet Appliances.” Combining 
elements of client-server computing, networking, and embedded systems 
design, the challenges and issues facing today’s Internet Appliance 
designers are so demanding and unique that TechOnLine is debuting 
APPLIANCENET in mid-January to support the hardware and software 
engineers braving this new world. You’ll find an interview with 
APPLIANCENET Editor Jeff Michalski in this month’s TechOnLine Review.

But there’s more…To get a jump on the launch of APPLIANCENET in January, 
TechOnLine is making many of the presentations at the recent Embedded 
Internet Workshop available to you online. You’ll find these described in 
TechOnLine Review and you’ll be able to access the complete presentations 
in the Feature Articles section of EMBEDDEDNET.

If you’re designing ASICs or programmable logic devices, don’t miss going
to TechOnline’s newest addition – EDANET. Here you’ll find more than a
half-dozen industry and technology viewpoints (in the Feature Articles 
section), directories of key EDA tools, and the most comprehensive 
listing of vendor sites offering demo EDA software you’ll find on the 
Internet.
