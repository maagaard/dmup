 ELECTRONIC MARKETING

 Cyberpreneurs are increasing tremendously with the boom of the
 digital/electronic frontier. Electronic marketing is a proven method
 with a global market. It is more advantageous than conventional
 methods and the risk is minimal. The prospects are millions.

 Electronic marketing is a proven and profitable method with a global
 market, incurring the smallest investment. It is more advantageous
 than conventional marketing and the risk is minimal. The prospects
 are millions worldwide and can be reached for pennies. A cyber
 business can be on autopilot and run 24 hrs a day. It can be worked
 at part time or full-time. If you are presently in business this is a
 great medium of marketing to consider. However, some effort is
 involved.

 PROFITABLE ITEMS TO MARKET  ON LINE  and/or  OFF LINE

 The Information Superhighway exists as bits of electrons within a
 network of computers, which forms cyberspace. The existence of the
 Information Superhighway narrows down to one important factor;
 information. INFORMATION IS POWER. Likewise, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

 The existence of the Information Superhighway narrows down to one
 important factor; information. It's been proven repeatedly that the
 ideal cyberspace products are books, software, computer related
 materials, information, and services. Most of businesses marketing
 these products and services on-line do so successfully while
 successfully marketing off-line as well.

 EXPERIENCE & EXPERTISE

 If you know the basics of the computer and on line, then you may
 qualify for a computer/on line based business. However, the right
 product & marketing method must be present to succeed. There are a
 number of excellent on line businesses out there. Be forewarned
 however, for various reasons not all of them are profitable.

 PRODUCTION COSTS  &  PROFITING

 Regardless of the product/service, most experts agree you must be
 able to produce the product to keep your product acquisition costs
 DOWN. To profit, you must keep your product acquisition costs DOWN.
 Normally, the way to do this is to produce your own product. For the
 beginner, lack of knowledge, product, time and capital necessary to
 operate a business is either insufficient or unavailable. However,
 because of the digital era and the medium created by the internet,
 many products can now be produced in-house, such as: software,
 information, electronic books, internet services, and etc...
