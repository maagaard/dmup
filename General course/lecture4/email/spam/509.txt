                             investment
                             THAT WORKS

     YES, Thats cool!!! Those of you who do take action will be
blessed
beyond your wildest hopes. The following was sent to me a week or so
ago.
After reading it, I just couldn't pas it up. I know that a lot of
peope
wish they could stay at home and make thousands of dollars. Well..
.here is this program on a major network tv show several months ago.
The network tv show determined that the program explaied below is a
service and is 100% legal. Take a few minutes to read over all of the
information enclosed, make a copy, then read it again. You won't be
sorry!GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!
Like a lot of people, I was looking ofr additional incme by replying
to
various advertisements on the internet and in newspapers. Having
worked
most of my adult life in financial profession. I was very impressed
with
following proposal.
A few weeks ago I recieve a letter from a fellow attorney that said, 
"I am
a retired attorney and about two years ago a man came in with a
letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter that you have
before you now." He asked me to review its contents to determin if
the letter was legal. I told him that I would look it over and get
back to him thht my opinion. When I first read the letter I thought
it was an "off the wall" idea to make money.
A few weeks later, I met with a client to discuss the issue. I told
him the letter as originally given to me was a 100% legal. Naturally,
I was corious about the letter, so he told me how it work, I decided
it was a long shot, so I decided against participating. However,
before my client left my office, I asked him to keep me updated as to
his results.
About two months later, he called to tell me that he had recieved
more than $800.00 in cash!!! Well, I didn't believe him, of course,
so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself. I thought about it
for a few days and decided that there wasn't much to lose. I followed
the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters. Sure enough, the
money started coming in. It came slowly at first, but after three
weeks, I was getting more mail than I could open in a day. After
about 13 weeks, the money stopped coming. I kept precies record for
my
earnings and at the end of it, it totaled $868,439.00!! I earn a good
living as a attorney, but as anyone in the legal profession will you
there is a lot of stress that comes with the territory. I decided
that if things sorted out, I would retire from my practice and play
golf. In this time I sent out 500 letters... well, a little more than
three months later, I totaled $2,344,178.00!!! I met my old client
for lunch to find out exactly how it
works. He told me that there were a few similar letters going around.
What
made this one different is the fact that there are seven names onthe
letter...Not five like the others. The factor alone resulted in more
returns. The other factor was the advice I gave him in making certain
the whole thing was perfectly legal, since noone wants to risk doing
anything
illegal. I know you must be curious abut the little changes I advised
him to make for the letter to be legal. Well, when sending out a
letter like this one, to be legal, you must sell something in return.
So, when you send a dollar to
each of the seven names on the list, you must include a slip of paper
saying,
"Please add me to your mailing list", and include your your name,
mailing
address, and email address. This is the key to the program. The item
you
will recieve is this letter and the right to earn thousands. Follow
the
simple instructions exactly. More than $800.00 in cold hard cash!!!!
(1) Immediately send $1.00 to each of the seven names listed below.
The
sooner you send the dollar letters, the sooner you will start getting

email
resouces. " Remember...if you don't ask for this service, use of this
letter
will be illega for you.
