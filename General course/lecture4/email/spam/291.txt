Dear Webmaster - There is a link to your Web site from the companion site
to Ray Kurzweil's new book, "The Age of Spiritual Machines," on the
following page:

http://www.penguinputnam.com/kurzweil/links.htm

Would you consider installing a link back?  Kurzweil is one of the most
honored scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs of our time.  He has
helped machines act like humans, with pioneering contributions in the areas
of speech recognition, machine reading, OCR scanning, and synthesized
music.  His new book argues that machine intelligence will soon exceed
human intelligence, with profound implications.

I have written some HTML linking text, below, which you can use or modify
for the link.  If you have room for a graphical link, I can send a small
button graphic -- it's only 7k.  Thanks for your consideration and please
let me know if you plan to link or if you want the button GIF.

Sincerely,
JEREMY HART
