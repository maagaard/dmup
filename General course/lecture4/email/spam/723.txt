  if you have more than one e-mail address please list
  all of them in the body of your e-mail to us one address
  per line and type "e-mail" in the subject line instead
  of "remove".

  Continue receiving 1-5 e-mails a week from our
  General Marketing List.

  Now, if you would like to join one of LeadBlaster's specific lists for your
  interests simply choose from our advertisement lists below. Then send
  LeadBlaster Marketing a reply by clicking on the e-mail address adjacent to
  the category and say "Yes" in the subject line of that e-mail, you will
  then be added to that list. This action will remove you from our General
  Mailing list and all other lists you may be on. Should you choose to
  receive advertisement e-mails from more than one list or want to continue to
  receive advertisements from our General Mailing List then you will need to
