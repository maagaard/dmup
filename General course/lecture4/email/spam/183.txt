Hello,

  We would like to offer you a 3 month free trial of Stocks For
Tomorrow ($59.00 value), which researchs small cap stocks. 
We look for stocks that could move 100% or more in a year. 
You will be emailed 2 or 3 updates per week, which will give 
you the latest information on these small cap growth stocks 
and also some shorter term trading ideas. 

We are featuring two very exciting stocks. The first one is 
TESSA COMPLETE HEALTH CARE (TSSA), which provides a non-surgical 
alternative to to the treatment of orthopedic, muscular and 
neurological injuries. The Company has grown from 6 to 43 
clinics so far in 1998 and they currently have an additional 
40 clinics under Letter Of Intent, which are scheduled to be 
acquired in the fourth quarter of 1998. The additional 
acquisitions will increase revenues from $25 million to $45-50 
million. Earnings should grow from $.35-.40 to $.70-.80 per 
share after the additional clinics are acquired. Instead of 
just consolidating clinics under a corporate banner, Tessa 
increases the revenues of each new clinic by offering a wide 
range of services and it standing as a nationwide
healthcare provider allows new clinics to have access to the 
large insurance companies and other healthcare providers.

We look for the stock to move up to the $5-6 area in the 
short term. The Company has recently hired a major Wall Street 
Investment Banking firm to provide the necessary expansion 
capital for the growth to 200-300 clinics in the next two years. 
Tessa Heath Care will apply for a NASDAQ Small Cap listing when 
the stock price reaches $4.00. The Company can grow at a 50-100% 
rate over the next two years and we look for a target of $8-10 as
the Company makes other acquisitions and receives the NASDAQ 
Small Cap listing. There are currently only 500,000 free trading 
shares, so we could see a quick move up to our initial target 
price.

The second stock we are featuring is NATIONAL REHAB PROPERTIES 
(NRPI) which builds and rehabs "affordable housing". The Company 
operates in New Orleans and is now expanding operations to Miami 
and Tampa, FL. Their plans are to expand to 10-12 cities in the 
next two years. The Company buys, rehabs, sells and finances 
affordable homes to first home buyers. Under financing programs 
that are available, the monthly payment on these homes are 
comparable to what it would cost to rent the same home. Demand
for the homes is so great, that the Company has yet to complete a
renovation without the home being pre-sold. NRPI will start to 
build new homes in Miami and Tampa, that will also qualify as 
affordable housing, but their profit margin is nearly double 
for the new construction.

The stock is currently trading at 2-3 times earnings for the 
next 12 months. We look for a short term move of 100-200% and 
longer term up to the $2+ area. The company has only 2.2 million 
shares in the float and over half of those shares are in friendly 
hands. We think this stock could be a major winner over the next 
year as their business plan calls for 100% growth over the next 
two years.
