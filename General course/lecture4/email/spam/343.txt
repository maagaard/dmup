Hi,

I am trying to learn the SPM software that I down loaded from your web
site to analyze fMRI experiments. However, I am running into some
difficulties (even after reading though some of the literature
provided on the web site). 

In order to help me learn this software, I am wondering if it would be
possible for me to get a hold of an example data set with specified
parameters from you guys so that I can test it out for myself here and
see first hand how it works.

Thanks very much in advance.

-Andy Tsai
