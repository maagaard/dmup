Hello,
  I am a representative of a one of the fastest growing companies in the US. Earlier this
 year we expanded into the UK and Germany. We are now preparing to begin operations
in Denmark, Sweden and Holland. So we are looking for some good people.
 Our company shows people how they can build a residual income from the recent changes
in the telcommunications industry in your country. Consumers now have choices for the
first time and you can now earn an income from these services for the first time.
 If you would like information to see how you can be among the first in your country to partner
up with us, contact me at  patterson@acninc.net.
Thank You
Ron Patterson
