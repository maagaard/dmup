Dear Online Surfer,

I hate chain e-mails, and I despise multi-level marketing, but I ran
across something on the Internet today that I really do like. It is a
company that will actually pay you 60 cents an hour to surf the web.
Free of Charge! The reason is they are sharing part of the advertising
income with you.

They don't get in your way while on-line, and they don't make you
visit any special sites, they just have a simple little software
application that sits on your computer, displaying ads and counting
your money.

The application is no bigger than a typical banner ad, and you can
move it around anywhere on your screen, so it really isn't too
distracting. The ultimate thing about the concept is that they not
only pay you to surf the web, but will also pay you when your friends
and family are on-line as well.

For anyone you refer you are going to get 10 cent per hour down to 5
level!.You can use their online calculator to find out instantly why 
you can easily make USD1000+ every month. 

The 10 cent hourly rate per referral is double compare with other 
similar opp. which mean that you will earn double from your referrals
group!
