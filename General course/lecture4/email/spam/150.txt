America has a generous offer for people around the world, and we 
thought you might be interested in what America is offering !!!  The 
United States has a program, called DIVERSITY VISA LOTTERY, 
to give away 50,000 Permanent Residence Visas (Green Cards), 
by random selection, to people from countries with low rates of 
immigration to the United States.  The program is perfectly legal. 
A Green Card will give you legal right to work and live permanently
in the United States.  If you win a Green Card, you can apply for 
U.S. citizenship at a later time.
