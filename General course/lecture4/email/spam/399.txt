Unmasking Black Holes
Jean-Pierre Lasota 

Evidence for black holes was until recently all circumstantial. 
Distinguishing them at a distance from other highly compact, 
gravitationally massive bodies such as neutron stars is 
inherently problematic. Now astronomers may have direct proof: 
energy is vanishing from volumes of space without a trace. 
Scientific American

TSUNAMI!
Its awesome fury cannot be diminished, but lessons learned from a 
rash of disasters this decade--and a new way to track these 
killer waves--will help save lives. Scientific American

ITEM #05: Hot web sites, trends & topics

Go to www.hotbot.com they have an MPC search engine. Way ahead of 
the other search engines in this area.

MP3 is the fastest growing segment of the web site. What is MP3? 
This is a new file compression that is the standard for 
compressing music on the Internet. It gives you near CD-Quality 
music that you can download. 

The music publishers hate it with a passion are  trying to do 
everything they can to squash it.  So you must get a inexpensive 
CD-ROM writer ($199 after rebate at www.compusa.com) and start 
downloading your favorite tunes and making your own mix a copy 
them down to your own CD. I have a cable modem and can download 
them fast and have currently created 15 audio CD's with my 
favorite tunes. No longer do you have to lay out $15 for a CD to 
get one good song and 11 other fillers.

Need some artwork or photographs for your web site? Use 
www.altavista.com search engine that has the ability to search 
for clipart and photographs.

If you have a neat web site that you wish to share with our 
readers, send it to kristen@fastermail.com with the single word 
WEBPICK in the message subject line and the name of the web site 
and the exact URL or web site address in the message body. We
