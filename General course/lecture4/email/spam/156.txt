 story out to the public.  If you would like to be one of the first to receive a detailed
 investor relations package about this exciting company, please send an e-mail to

IPVoice is a new public company that targets the explosive potential in Internet
communications.  IPVoice will deliver products that allow companies and individuals
 to route their phone calls, faxes, and other data across the Internet with no sacrifice
 of quality compared to traditional telephone networks, but at substantial cost savings. 
 IPVoice is preparing to launch its first product, an Internet Gateway named 
TrueConnect.  The product will be launched at a major trade show in New York City
 in late September.  TrueConnect provides a gateway for bridging the public telephone
 system with the Internet.  With TrueConnect, users will be able to conduct real-time,
 full duplex, high quality two-way voice communications over the Internet.

To support the TrueConnect product, the company has completed several proprietary
 products that will allow the company and its distributors to offer a total solution in 
Internet Telephony.  These products include MultiCom, a complete order entry,
 billing, customer service, agent management and switching network management
 system for telecommunications businesses worldwide.  Distributors are being signed
 up to sell the product throughout the world.  IPVoice management recently signed
 agreements with distributors in China and Spain.  IPVoice is in the final stages of 
negotiation for establishing distribution agreements in South America, Mexico and 
Moscow.  IPVoice continues to negotiate directly with distributors in the
 United Kingdom, the Caribbean, India and Germany.
