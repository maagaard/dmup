I can not answer your question regarding what the SPM program does, but
indeed it is theoretically correct to convolve the boxcar with the HRF
twice. This is because the underlying neural activity has been convolved
twice (given the assumptions one makes): once by physiology (which
one could heuristically associated with your "1st" HRF convolution)
and once by the matrix operations peformed in the SPM program.

Sincerely,
Eric
