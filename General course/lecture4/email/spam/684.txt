   PATTERNS?
o  DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT VOIP QUALITY OF SERVICE ISSUES AND 
   HOW THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED?
o  DO YOU  NEED TO BUILD IP PHONE, IPBX, CABLE MODEM, DSL, OR

If so, join Texas Instruments and Telogy Networks, a Texas 
Instruments Company, at http://www.techonline.com for the 
industry's first TechOnLine University course on Voice over 
Internet Protocol. (See details below for accessing the course.)

As the leading provider of VoIP hardware and software, TI and 
Telogy bring you an educational training course designed to keep 
you informed of the latest developments and benefits in the fast 
growing packetized voice industry.

The 1½ hour course is divided into 4 easy-to-follow modules, 
including:

o MODULE 1: Anatomy of Internet Phone Calls (20 MINS.)
o MODULE 2: Internet Telephony: The Case for Universal Ports 
  (30 MINS.)
o MODULE 3: Implementation Challenges (30 MINS.)
o MODULE 4: Applications (15 MINS.)

MODULE 1 explains the anatomy of an Internet phone call and 
describes what actually happens when voice travels over a packet 
network. It further identifies problems inherent with Internet 
telephony and explains how these problems can be addressed.

MODULE 2 is designed to introduce the basics of traditional 
telephony and highlight the roles of gateways and remote access 
servers in the transmission and reception of voice, fax, and 
modem data. Participants will be able to identify the roles of 
gateways and remote access servers and explain the benefits of a 
universal port solution that integrates voice, fax and data 
modem capabilities.

MODULE 3 outlines and identifies the challenges involved in 
implementing a Voice Over Internet Protocol solution, and 
explains the types of features that should be included.

MODULE 4 reviews the major development areas for VoIP products 
and details six key application areas.
