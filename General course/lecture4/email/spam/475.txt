June 22,1999
 
Company Press Release
 
WCollect becoming E-commerce force
 
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--June 22, 1999--WCollect.com (OTCBB: WCLT) 
WCollect is establishing itself as the leading online provider in 
the e-commerce sector.  
 
"The company itself has made huge strides in a very short period 
of time." Said D. Bruce Robb formally of Midland Walwyn now Merrill 
Lynch.  "When one considers the company has been in existence for 
little more than 4 months and has closed marketing and business 
agreements with companies and organizations such as; King World, 
Just Systems, and an institution the size and breadth of The 
National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS), Inc., 
is just overwhelming", he said.  WCollect has had one take over 
offer, which the company turned down.  "Given the growing number 
of joint ventures and other business opportunities that continue 
to come to the company, we (the board of directors) didn't think 
that the offer was in line with the growth we are experiencing." 
said Stewart Irvine President and CEO. "We have no doubt that other 
offers will arrive as we continue to grow our data base from a 
customer list of mid to high end consumers. In some circles we 
are referred to as the Robb Report of the Auction and Gallery 
Sites, however the impressive aspect of our business strategy 
is the high margin revenue model."
 
Similar to EBAY (NASDAQ: EBAY) in the fact that the company carries 
no inventory, and like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) where there are also 
fixed price items with substantially higher margins and a strong 
business to consumer sales focus. The WCollect business model is 
proven and what is unique is that they have taken the best of two 
worlds and combined them with a Guarantee of authenticity. 
 
WCollect which deals exclusively in the online sale of fine art, 
entertainment collectibles, and sports memorabilia went public in 
mid February 1999, and has made other considerable inroads into 
the growing Internet-based auction and E-commerce business, including:
 
 generating an average of 50% revenue from sales via its Gallery 
Shop where consumers can purchase authenticated items at a fixed 
cost at lower than retail prices.
 building a secure Web site of significant proportions that offers 
direct access to the $50 billion annual market of collectibles 
through strategic partnerships in the fields of fine art, authenticated 
celebrity and sports memorabilia.
 
 prominent cross-promotion on internationally syndicated television 
programs, including King World's  "The Roseanne Show" and the 1999 
Grammy Awards.
 
 establishing The World Collectors Guild, a non-profit organization 
designed as an online community where the millions of collectors will 
exchange ideas and can add authenticated rare and one of a kind items 
to their collections.
 
 WCollect.com, is now less than 30 days from introduction of the 
carrier class site which will merchandize the initial 20% of the 
current one million items in its virtual directory.
 
WCollect.com has positioned itself to become the world's largest 
most trusted art and collectibles Gallery and Auction Company. This 
will position WCollect to be on par with Ebay for value of content 
online and Amazon.com for the number of items offered online.
 
WCollect is publicly traded under the symbol WCLT  (OTC BB)
