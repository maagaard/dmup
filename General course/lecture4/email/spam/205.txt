BOOST YOUR WEB SITE'S TRAFFIC--GET LISTED ON YAHOO!


----------------

THE MARKETING BENEFITS OF HAVING A YAHOO! LISTING


FACT: Yahoo! is the most important search engine/directory 
on which your Web site can be listed.  

FACT: Independently conducted Internet studies show that 
42% of all Internet traffic and 70% of all business-to-
business Web site traffic is generated from Yahoo!.

FACT: Getting your Web site listed on Yahoo! is without 
question the single most important marketing step you can 
take to promote your Web site. 


EXAMPLE: For some of our clients, a Yahoo! listing is the 
only Internet advertising they have--and the only 
advertising they need. 

EXAMPLE: Some of our clients now receive over 20,000 
hits per *day* and do well over $100,000 in Internet sales 
per month--not from expensive advertising, but all from a
single Yahoo listing.




----------------

YAHOO! REJECTS 90% OF ALL SUBMITTED WEB SITES--BE IN THE 10%


PROBLEM: In case you didn't know, Yahoo!'s staff rejects 
over 90% of the submissions they receive. 


SOLUTION: Our R&D division has studied hundreds of sites--
both those that have been successfuly indexed and those that 
have been rejected.

SOLUTION: Based on our findings, we've helped hundreds of 
clients not only get their site into the Yahoo! index, but 
into a very prominent place within that index. 

The Yahoo! Project Team can do the same for you.




----------------

MY SITE HAS ALREADY BEEN REJECTED BY YAHOO! WHAT CAN I DO?

PROBLEM: "I submitted my site to Yahoo! but it was rejected. 
What can I do now?"

SOLUTION: If your site has already been rejected--don't 
despair. We've helped many clients' sites get into Yahoo!'s 
index even after they've been rejected.





----------------

THE YAHOO! SITE SELECTION PROCESS--IN A NUTSHELL

"I can just submit my URL and be considered for a listing, 
right? It's easy, isn't it?"

No. It's not. Read on to learn why.


PROBLEM: Every site that gets accepted into the Yahoo! 
directory is scrutinized by a Yahoo! "editor." The first 
step in the submission process is to get an already 
overworked editor to look at your site.

SOLUTION: We have a carefully-researched technique to 
help your site's chances of being examined.



PROBLEM: Before submitting, your site *must* be prepared
for the Yahoo! editor's "10 minute lookover." In order
to grab that editor's attention--and get listed--you need
to understand what he or she will be examining to 
determine if your Web site gets a Yahoo! listing.  

SOLUTION: Our R&D division has studied hundreds of Yahoo! 
rejection letters and learned why Yahoo! editors commonly 
reject sites. In short, we can *tell* you

SOLUTION: THE "SECRETS TO GETTING A TOP YAHOO! LISTING" REPORT

We offer an information-packed "Secrets to getting a top 
Yahoo! listing" report that will tell you exactly what 
Yahoo! editors will be looking for when they evaluate your 
site.

your site.


Here's what's covered in the report:

<> A general overview of Yahoo! and how it works

     our clients!

FOR THE SERIOUS SITE OWNER--THE CUSTOMIZED YAHOO! EVALUATION


We also offer a "Customized Evaluation" service where we'll 
examine your site like a Yahoo! editor will--and tell you, 
step-by-step, each of the changes you'll need to make before 
submitting to Yahoo!.

from the "Secrets to getting a top Yahoo! listing" report *plus*:

<> A customized evaluation of your competitors' sites and why 
      they are so important to consider before submitting
