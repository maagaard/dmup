Greetings from SoundStone.com!

I recently visited Finn Årup Nielsen and want to explore the possibility of
working with you to promote music on-line. 

Our music-retail website offers the LARGEST (over 310,000) selection of
albums available on-line.  The SoundStone.com approach to CD sales is
unique.  We provide visitors with interesting and informative content from
writers who are intelligent and entertaining (with just the proper degree
of quirkiness).  Check it out and tell us what you think.

If you are interested in linking with us so your visitors can come to
SoundStone.com to purchase music, please contact us or check out our
Affiliate Network Program.  The ANP is designed to compensate those
websites that link with us.  We will pay you up to 15% of sales revenue in
CASH for every CD purchased at SoundStone.com by a customer coming from
your site. It's our way of creating an on-line music community and saying
THANK YOU for linking!  It is entirely up to you if you wish to join this
Program and simply setting up a link is always an option.

SoundStone.com was recently selected as a Lycos Top 5% site and we had a
huge write-up in the "Merchants & Marketing" section of the 1/17 Billboard
(yeah!).

E-mail us with any questions you have.  We hope to hear from you soon!

Keep on rockin' in the Web world,

Chris
