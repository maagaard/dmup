For sentiment analyzing of tweets with a given hashtag, several issues arise. First of all there is the data mining part; a great amount of tweets are needed. This will have to be queried from Twitter, and therefore use the Twitter API. The free Twitter API has certain limits, that makes this cumbersome. 

Secondly there is the sentiment analyzing part. The are several python modules that offer sentiment analysis of some kind. The approach in this project, was however, to train our own analyzer and use that for the analysis. 

Lastly, the results are to be shown to a user, the one who desires a sentiment analysis of a given hashtag. 


How this is solved...
