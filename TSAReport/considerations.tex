Considerations:



- Querying the twitter timeline
    - max_id's and so on


- Classification
    - size of featureset --> cost/benefit 
    - atm. 100 tweets --> 30 seconds


- Discrimination:
    - How do decide what a tweet is?
    - How to use the information (positive, negative, objective)





- Many more interesting things to conclude, other than the ones that we have done:
    - Country
    - gender
    - time of day
    - other tendencies?
    
- If were to used together with more mining:
    - compare with data from news media to see if there are any indications on anything? or connections


- Location:
    - user location
