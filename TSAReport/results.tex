The application as a whole can be run through ``website.py'', 
which renders a web front-end on ``localhost:5000'' and gives the user access to querying tweets.
The front-end is shown on \autoref{fig:website}, where the hashtag ``\#python'' has been queried.

While the web-interface does look rather simplistic, there's a lot of moving parts behind it.
The steps for querying a hashtag are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look up tweets using the Twitter API
\item De-serialize the tweet from JSON to the appropriate domain model
\item Extract the feature-set of the tweets
\item Analyze the sentiment polarity of the tweets
\item Insert the analyzed tweets into the PostgreSQL database
\item Render a graph of the analyzed tweets
\item Render the updated web-interface to the user
\end{enumerate}

One of the limitations of the current implementation, is that querying Twitter takes a relatively long period of time,
approximately 5 seconds per 100 tweets. 
This makes it hard to get a very precise and dense result set, but it does give us an impression of how a more complete system would behave.
